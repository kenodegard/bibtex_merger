Code structure
==============

code/
	cleanup.py			the core script that runs everything as necessary
	fminunc/			the support code (MATLAB) for the fminunc (logistic regression ) algorithm
	glmfit/				the support code (MATLAB) for the glmfit (generalized linear model) algorithm
	bibtexparser/		the support code (python) for parsing the bibtex entries,
						this is an updated adaptation of
						https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibtexparser/0.6.0
data/
	0_original/			the original (unaltered) datasets
	1_prelearning/		the outputs from the python script used by fminunc to learn
						a prediction model

-------------------
System Requirements
===================

The code requires:
	python 2.6 or better
		numpy 1.9.2 or better
		Levenshtein 0.12.0 or better
		fuzzy 1.0 or better
		gmpy2 2.0.5 or better
	MATLAB 2014a or better
		Bioinformatics Toolbox
		Neural Network Toolbox
		Optimization Toolbox
		Parallel Computing Toolbox
		Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

------------------
Running cleanup.py
==================

1. First navigate into the code/ directory.
2. python cleanup.py

Look into the __init__() method to toggle flags for the various functions. These flags are also explained in the code.

There are 3 ways to run the code and the corresponding value that must be
set for flag self.doLearning:
	1. (self.learning_remakeData)	Building the dataset for the learning model training
	2. (self.learning_modeling)		Recreating the learning models based on pre-existing dataset
									Note that this step requires there to be datasets in the 1_prelearning directory
	3. (self.learning_off)			Detect duplicates using a pre-existing prediction model
									Note that this step requires theta values to be set in the self.theta value

There are 2 available learning models that can be toggled via the self.learningModel flag:
	1. 'fminunc'
	2. 'glmfit'
