	Abstract = {Advances in simulation techniques and computing hardware have created a substantial overlap between the timescales accessible to atomic-level simulations and those on which the fastest-folding proteins fold. Here we demonstrate, using simulations of four variants of the human villin headpiece, how simulations of spontaneous folding and unfolding can provide direct access to thermodynamic and kinetic quantities such as folding rates, free energies, folding enthalpies, heat capacities, Φ-values, and temperature-jump relaxation profiles. The quantitative comparison of simulation results with various forms of experimental data probing different aspects of the folding process can facilitate robust assessment of the accuracy of the calculations while providing a detailed structural interpretation for the experimental observations. In the example studied here, the analysis of folding rates, Φ-values, and folding pathways provides support for the notion that a norleucine double mutant of villin folds five times faster than the wild-type sequence, but following a slightly different pathway. This work showcases how computer simulation has now developed into a mature tool for the quantitative computational study of protein folding and dynamics that can provide a valuable complement to experimental techniques.},

@article{gipson2012computational-models-of-protein-kinematics,
	Abstract = {Physics-based simulation represents a powerful method for investigating the time-varying behavior of dynamic protein systems at high spatial and temporal resolution. Such simulations, however, can be prohibitively difficult or lengthy for large proteins or when probing the lower-resolution, long-timescale behaviors of proteins generally. Importantly, not all questions about a protein system require full space and time resolution to produce an informative answer. For instance, by avoiding the simulation of uncorrelated, high-frequency atomic movements, a larger, domain-level picture of protein dynamics can be revealed. The purpose of this review is to highlight the growing body of complementary work that goes beyond simulation. In particular, this review focuses on methods that address kinematics and dynamics, as well as those that address larger organizational questions and can quickly yield useful information about the long-timescale behavior of a protein. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Analytical Chemistry Volume 5 is June 15, 2012. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/catalog/pubdates.aspx for revised estimates.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new motion planner, Search Tree with Resolution Independent Density Estimation (STRIDE), designed for rapid exploration and path planning in high-dimensional systems (greater than 10). A Geometric Near- neighbor Access Tree (GNAT) is maintained to estimate the sampling density of the configuration space, allowing an implicit, resolution-independent, Voronoi partitioning to provide sampling density estimates, naturally guiding the planner towards unexplored regions of the configuration space. This planner is capable of rapid exploration in the full dimension of the configuration space and, given that a GNAT requires only a valid distance metric, STRIDE is largely parameter-free. Extensive experimental results demonstrate significant dimension- dependent performance improvements over alternative state-of-the-art planners. In particular, high-dimensional systems where the free space is mostly defined by narrow passages were found to yield the greatest performance improvements. Experimental results are shown for both a classical 6-dimensional problem and those for which the dimension incrementally varies from 3 to 27.},

abstract = {Modeling conformational changes in protein docking calculations is challenging. To make the calculations tractable, most current docking algorithms typically treat proteins as rigid bodies and use soft scoring functions that implicitly accommodate some degree of flexibility. Alternatively, ensembles of structures generated from molecular dynamics (MD) may be cross-docked. However, such combinatorial approaches can produce many thousands or even millions of docking poses, and require fast and sensitive scoring functions to distinguish them. Here, we present a novel approach called "EigenHex," which is based on normal mode analyses (NMAs) of a simple elastic network model of protein flexibility. We initially assume that the proteins to be docked are rigid, and we begin by performing conventional soft docking using the Hex polar Fourier correlation algorithm. We then apply a pose-dependent NMA to each of the top 1000 rigid body docking solutions, and we sample and re-score multiple perturbed docking conformations generated from linear combinations of up to 20 eigenvectors using a multi-threaded particle swarm optimization algorithm. When applied to the 63 "rigid body" targets of the Protein Docking Benchmark version 2.0, our results show that sampling and re-scoring from just one to three eigenvectors gives a modest but consistent improvement for these targets. Thus, pose-dependent NMA avoids the need to sample multiple eigenvectors and it offers a promising alternative to combinatorial cross-docking.},

abstract = {The NMSim web server implements a three-step approach for multiscale modeling of protein conformational changes. First, the protein structure is coarse-grained using the FIRST software. Second, a rigid cluster normal-mode analysis provides low-frequency normal modes. Third, these modes are used to extend the recently introduced idea of constrained geometric simulations by biasing backbone motions of the protein, whereas side chain motions are biased toward favorable rotamer states (NMSim). The generated structures are iteratively corrected regarding steric clashes and stereochemical constraint violations. The approach allows performing three simulation types: unbiased exploration of conformational space; pathway generation by a targeted simulation; and radius of gyration-guided simulation. On a data set of proteins with experimentally observed conformational changes, the NMSim approach has been shown to be a computationally efficient alternative to molecular dynamics simulations for conformational sampling of proteins. The generated conformations and pathways of conformational transitions can serve as input to docking approaches or more sophisticated sampling techniques. The web server output is a trajectory of generated conformations, Jmol representations of the coarse-graining and a subset of the trajectory and data plots of structural analyses. The NMSim webserver, accessible at http://www.nmsim.de, is free and open to all users with no login requirement.},

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a widely used technique to study dynamics of both proteins and nucleic acids. However, simulating molecular machines containing several thousands of amino acids, on long enough time scales to observe relevant structural deformation, remains challenging. Normal mode analysis (NMA) is better suited to study the slow dynamics of proteins. We briefly describe the theory underlying NMA and the simplifications used to render it tractable for (large) proteins. We also describe different kinds of analyses that can be performed on the eigenvectors to characterize the dynamical properties of the system. A number of validation studies are then summarized. Finally we describe NMA servers available on the Internet.},

We have developed a general geometry-based algorithm that efficiently samples conformational space under constraints imposed by low-resolution density maps obtained from electron microscopy or X-ray crystallography experiments. A deformable elastic network (DEN) is used to restrain the sampling to prior knowledge of an approximate structure. The DEN restraints dramatically reduce over-fitting, especially at low resolution. Cross-validation is used to optimally weight the structural information and experimental data. Our algorithm is robust even for noise-added density maps and has a large radius of convergence for our test case.

Molecular Dynamics has gained substantial use, but remains computationally demanding and difficult to setup for many biologists. Elastic network models (ENMs) are an alternative and have been shown to generate the dominant equilibrium motions of biomolecules quickly and efficiently. These dominant motions have been shown to be functionally relevant and also to indicate the likely direction of conformational changes. Most structures have a small number of dominant motions. Comparing computed motions to the structure's conformational ensemble derived from a collection of static structures or frames from an MD trajectory is an important way to understand functional motions as well as evaluate the models. Modes of motion computed from ENMs can be visualized to gain functional and mechanistic understanding and to compute useful quantities such as average positional fluctuations, internal distance changes, collectiveness of motions, and directional correlations within the structure.},
