	Abstract = {One particularly time-consuming step in protein crystallography is interpreting the electron density map; that is, fitting a complete molecular model of the protein into a 3D image of the protein produced by the crystallographic process. In poor-quality electron density maps, the interpretation may require a significant amount of a crystallographer's time. Our work investigates automating the time-consuming initial backbone trace in poor-quality density maps. We describe ACMI (Automatic Crystallographic Map Interpreter), which uses a probabilistic model known as a Markov field to represent the protein. Residues of the protein are modeled as nodes in a graph, while edges model pairwise structural interactions. Modeling the protein in this manner allows the model to be flexible, considering an almost infinite number of possible conformations, while rejecting any that are physically impossible. Using an efficient algorithm for approximate inference--belief propagation--allows the most probable trace of the protein's backbone through the density map to be determined. We test ACMI on a set of ten protein density maps (at 2.5 to 4.0 A resolution), and compare our results to alternative approaches. At these resolutions, ACMI offers a more accurate backbone trace than current approaches.},

	Abstract = {Several methods for automatically constructing a protein model from an electron-density map require searching for many small protein-fragment templates in the density. We propose to use the spherical-harmonic decomposition of the template and the maps density to speed this matching. Unlike other template-matching approaches, this allows us to eliminate large portions of the map unlikely to match any templates. We train several first-pass filters for this elimination task. We show our new template-matching method improves accuracy and reduces running time, compared to previous approaches. Finally, we extend our method to produce a structural-homology detection algorithm using electron density.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: One bottleneck in high-throughput protein crystallography is interpreting an electron-density map, that is, fitting a molecular model to the 3D picture crystallography produces. Previously, we developed ACMI (Automatic Crystallographic Map Interpreter), an algorithm that uses a probabilistic model to infer an accurate protein backbone layout. Here, we use a sampling method known as particle filtering to produce a set of all-atom protein models. We use the output of ACMI to guide the particle filter's sampling, producing an accurate, physically feasible set of structures.
RESULTS: We test our algorithm on 10 poor-quality experimental density maps. We show that particle filtering produces accurate all-atom models, resulting in fewer chains, lower sidechain RMS error and reduced R factor, compared to simply placing the best-matching sidechains on ACMI's trace. We show that our approach produces a more accurate model than three leading methods--Textal, Resolve and ARP/WARP--in terms of main chain completeness, sidechain identification and crystallographic R factor.
