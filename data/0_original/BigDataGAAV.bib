@article{Caleb1,
abstract = {The hippocampus is thought to be involved in episodic memory formation by reactivating traces of waking experience during sleep. Indeed, the joint firing of spatially tuned pyramidal cells encoding nearby places recur during sleep. We found that the sleep cofiring of rat CA1 pyramidal cells encoding similar places increased relative to the sleep session before exploration. This cofiring increase depended on the number of times that cells fired together with short latencies (<50 ms) during exploration, and was strongest between cells representing the most visited places. This is indicative of a Hebbian learning rule in which changes in firing associations between cells are determined by the number of waking coincident firing events. In contrast, cells encoding different locations reduced their cofiring in proportion to the number of times that they fired independently. Together these data indicate that reactivated patterns are shaped by both positive and negative changes in cofiring, which are determined by recent behavior.},

@article{Caleb2,
abstract = {The hippocampus is critical for spatial learning and memory. Hippocampal neurons in awake animals exhibit place field activity that encodes current location, as well as sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity during which representations based on past experiences are often replayed. The relationship between these patterns of activity and the memory functions of the hippocampus is poorly understood. We interrupted awake SWRs in animals learning a spatial alternation task. We observed a specific learning and performance deficit that persisted throughout training. This deficit was associated with awake SWR activity, as SWR interruption left place field activity and post-experience SWR reactivation intact. These results provide a link between awake SWRs and hippocampal memory processes, which suggests that awake replay of memory-related information during SWRs supports learning and memory-guided decision-making.},

abstract = {Hippocampal replay is thought to be essential for the consolidation of event memories in hippocampal-neocortical networks. Replay is present during both sleep and waking behavior, but although sleep replay involves the reactivation of stored representations in the absence of specific sensory inputs, awake replay is thought to depend on sensory input from the current environment. Here, we show that stored representations are reactivated during both waking and sleep replay. We found frequent awake replay of sequences of rat hippocampal place cells from a previous experience. This spatially remote replay was as common as local replay of the current environment and was more robust when the rat had recently been in motion than during extended periods of quiescence. Our results indicate that the hippocampus consistently replays past experiences during brief pauses in waking behavior, suggesting a role for waking replay in memory consolidation and retrieval.},
