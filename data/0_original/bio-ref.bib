  abstract     = {Implantable ventricular assist devices give hope of a permanent clinical solution to heart
                  failure. These devices, both pulsatile- and continuous-flow, are presently used as medium-term bridge to
                  heart transplant or recovery. While long-term use of continuous-flow axial and centrifugal pumps is being
                  explored, the excessive level of blood damage in these devices has emerged as a design challenge. Blood
                  damage depends both on shear stress and exposure time, and device designers have relied traditionally on
                  global space- and time-averaged estimates from experimental studies to make design decisions. Measuring
                  distributions of shear stress levels and the blood cell's exposure to these conditions in complex rotary
                  pump flow is difficult. On the other hand, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is now being used as a tool
                  for designing viable devices, offering more detailed information about the flow field. A tensor-based
                  blood damage model for CFD analysis is proposed here. The model estimates the time- and space-dependent
                  strain experienced by individual blood cells and correlates it to blood damage data from steady shear
                  flow experiments. The blood cells are modeled as deforming droplets and their deformation is tracked
                  along the pathlines of a computed flow. The model predicts that blood cells in a rapidly fluctuating
                  shear flow can sustain high shear stress levels for very short exposure time without deforming
                  considerably. In the context of mechanical modeling of the implantable Gyro blood pump being developed at
                  Baylor College of Medicine, this suggests that blood cells traversing regions of highly fluctuating shear
                  stress rapidly may not hemolyze significantly.},

                  as well as a traditional model. Three typical operating conditions for the pump are simulated with a
                  special-purpose finite element-based flow solver, and a novel approach for tracing the pathlines in
                  discretely represented time-varying flow in a complex domain is presented, and 271 pathlines are traced
                  through the pump. Hemolysis is computed along the pathlines, and the accumulated hemolysis at the outflow
                  is converted into standard clinical units. The cumulative hemolysis at the outlet of the pump is weighted
                  with the flow rate associated with the pathlines, and a temporal average is obtained by releasing the
                  tracer particles at different time intervals. Numerical predictions are compared to experimental
                  hemolysis studies performed according to the American Society for Testing and Materials standards at the

                  experimental results, whereas the traditional model overpredicts the hemolysis. The success of the
                  tensor-based blood-damage model is attributed to its construction, which accounts for blood-specific
                  physical properties and phenomena. Hemolysis values at the typical operating conditions of the pump are
                  found to be within the clinically accepted range.},

                  computing viscoelastic flows of complex fluids described by the conformation tensor; it extends the
                  well-established GLS method for computing flows of incompressible Newtonian fluids. GLS methods are
                  attractive for large-scale computations because they yield linear systems that can be solved easily with
                  iterative solvers (e.g., the Generalized Minimum Residual method) and because they allow simple
                  combinations of interpolation functions that can be conveniently and efficiently implemented on modern
                  distributed-memory cache-based clusters. Like other state-of-the-art methods forcomputing viscoelastic
                  flows (e.g., DEVSS-TG/SUPG), the new GLS method introduces a separate variable to represent the velocity
                  gradient; with the aid of this variable, the conservation equations of mass, momentum, conformation, and
                  the definition of velocity gradient are converted into a set of first-order partial differential
                  equations in four unknown fields-pressure, velocity, conformation, and velocity gradient. The unknown
                  fields are represented by low-order (continuous piecewise linear or bilinear) finite element basis
                  functions. The method is applied to the Oldroyd-B constitutive equation and is tested in two benchmark

                  mesh-convergence rate of GLS is comparable to the DEVSS-TG/SUPG method; (2) the LS stabilization permits
                  using equal-order basis functions for all fields; (3) GLS handles effectively the advective terms in the

                  costs than DEVSS-type methods. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

                  matrix-logarithm of the conformation tensor, J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 123 (2004) 281-285]. This
                  formulation ensures that solutions of viscoelastic flow problems are physically admissible, and it is
                  able to capture sharp elastic stress layers. However, the implementations presented in literature thus
                  far require changing the evolution equation for the conformation tensor into an equation for its
                  logarithm, and are based on loosely coupled (partitioned) solution procedures [M.A. Hulsen, et al., Flow
                  of viscoelastic fluids past a cylinder at high Weissenberg number: stabilized simulations using matrix
                  logarithms, J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 127 (2005) 27-39]. A simple alternate form of the
                  log-conformation formulation is presented in this article, and an implementation is demonstrated in the
                  DEVSS-TG/SUPG finite element method. Besides its straightforward implementation, the new log-conformation
                  formulation can be used to solve al I the governing equations (continuity, conservation of momentum and
                  constitutive equation) in a strongly coupled way by Newton's method. The method can be applied to any
                  conformation tensor model. The flows of Oldroyd-B and Larson-type fluids are tested in the benchmark
                  problem of a flow past a cylinder in a channel. The accuracy of the method is assessed by comparing
                  solutions with published results. The benefits of this new implementation and the pending issues are

                  whose shape is species-specific and within which the cells sporulate. Early in this process, cells often
                  pass through a "ripple phase" characterized by traveling linear, concentric, and spiral waves. These
                  waves are different from the waves observed during slime mold aggregation that depend on diffusible
                  morphogens, because myxobacteria communicate by direct contact. The difference is most dramatic when
                  waves collide: rather than annihilating one another, myxobacterial waves appear to pass through one
                  another unchanged. Under certain conditions, the spacing and location of the nascent fruiting bodies is
                  determined by the wavelength and pattern of the waves. Later in fruiting body development, waves are
                  replaced by streams of cells that circulate around small initial aggregates enlarging and rounding them.
                  Still later, pairs of motile aggregates coalesce to form larger aggregates that develop into fruiting
                  bodies. Here we present a mathematical model that quantitatively explains these wave and aggregation

                  co-ordinated programmes of gene expression within two unequal cell compartments, the mother cell and the
                  smaller forespore. sigmaF is the first compartment-specific transcription factor activated during this
                  process, and it is controlled at the post-translational level by a partner-switching mechanism that
                  restricts sigmaF activity to the forespore. The crux of this mechanism lies in the ability of the
                  anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB (AB) to form alternative complexes either with sigmaF, holding it in an
                  inactive form, or with the anti-anti-sigma factor SpoIIAA (AA) and a nucleotide, either ATP or ADP. In
                  the complex with AB and ATP, AA is phosphorylated on a serine residue and released, making AB available
                  to capture sigmaF in an inactive complex. Subsequent activation of sigmaF requires the intervention of
                  the SpoIIE serine phosphatase to dephosphorylate AA, which can then attack the AB-sigmaF complex to
                  induce the release of sigmaF. By incorporating biochemical, biophysical and genetic data from the
                  literature we have constructed an integrative mathematical model of this partner-switching network. The
                  model predicts that the self-enhancing formation of a long-lived complex of AA, AB and ADP transforms the
                  network into an essentially irreversible hysteretic switch, thereby explaining the sharp, robust and
                  irreversible activation of sigmaF in the forespore compartment. The model also clarifies the
                  contributions of the partly redundant mechanisms that ensure correct spatial and temporal activation of
                  sigmaF, reproduces the behaviour of various mutants and makes strong, testable predictions.},

  abstract     = {Regulatory networks controlling bacterial gene expression often evolve from common origins,
                  and share homologous proteins and similar network motifs. However, when functioning in different
                  physiological contexts, these motifs may be re-arranged with different topologies that significantly
                  affect network performance. Here we analyze two related signaling networks in the bacterium Bacillus
                  subtilis in order to assess the consequences of their different topologies, with the aim of formulating
                  design principles applicable to other systems. These two networks control the activities of the general
                  stress response factor sigma(B) and the first sporulation-specific factor sigma(F). Both networks have at
                  their core a "partner-switching" mechanism, in which an anti-sigma factor forms alternate complexes
                  either with the sigma factor, holding it inactive, or with an anti-anti-sigma factor, thereby freeing
                  sigma. However, clear differences in network structure are apparent: the anti-sigma factor for sigma(F)
                  forms a long-lived, "dead-end" complex with its anti-anti-sigma factor and ADP, whereas the genes
                  encoding sigma(B) and its network partners lie in a sigma(B)-controlled operon, resulting in positive and
                  negative feedback loops. We constructed mathematical models of both networks and examined which features
                  were critical for the performance of each design. The sigma(F) model predicts that the self-enhancing
                  formation of the dead-end complex transforms the network into a largely irreversible hysteretic switch;
                  the simulations reported here also demonstrate that hysteresis and slow turn off kinetics are the only
                  two system properties associated with this complex formation. By contrast, the sigma(B) model predicts
                  that the positive and negative feedback loops produce graded, reversible behavior with high regulatory
                  capacity and fast response time. Our models demonstrate how alterations in network design result in
                  different system properties that correlate with regulatory demands. These design principles agree with
                  the known or suspected roles of similar networks in diverse bacteria.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial two-component systems (TCS) are key signal transduction networks regulating global
                  responses to environmental change. Environmental signals may modulate the phosphorylation state of sensor
                  kinases (SK). The phosphorylated SK transfers the phosphate to its cognate response regulator (RR), which
                  causes physiological response to the signal. Frequently, the SK is bifunctional and, when
                  unphosphorylated, it is also capable of dephosphorylating the RR. The phosphatase activity may also be
                  modulated by environmental signals. Using the EnvZ/OmpR system as an example, we constructed mathematical
                  models to examine the steady-state and kinetic properties of the network. Mathematical modelling reveals
                  that the TCS can show bistable behaviour for a given range of parameter values if unphosphorylated SK and
                  RR form a dead-end complex that prevents SK autophosphorylation. Additionally, for bistability to exist
                  the major dephosphorylation flux of the RR must not depend on the unphosphorylated SK. Structural
                  modelling and published affinity studies suggest that the unphosphorylated SK EnvZ and the RR OmpR form a
                  dead-end complex. However, bistability is not possible because the dephosphorylation of OmpR
                  approximately P is mainly done by unphosphorylated EnvZ. The implications of this potential bistability
                  in the design of the EnvZ/OmpR network and other TCS are discussed.},

                  separate vegetative cells from endospore-containing cells and compared the transcriptome profiles of both
                  subpopulations. This demonstrated the differential expression of various regulons. Subsequent single-cell
                  analyses using promoter-gfp fusions confirmed our microarray results. Surprisingly, only part of the
