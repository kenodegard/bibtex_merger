abstract ={Driven by chemistry but increasingly guided by pharmacology and the clinical sciences, drug research has contributed more to the progress of medicine during the past century than any other scientific factor. The advent of molecular biology and, in particular, of genomic sciences is having a deep impact on drug discovery. Recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies have greatly enriched our therapeutic armamentarium. Genome sciences, combined with bioinformatic tools, allow us to dissect the genetic basis of multifactorial diseases and to determine the most suitable points of attack for future medicines, thereby increasing the number of treatment options. The dramatic increase in the complexity of drug research is enforcing changes in the institutional basis of this interdisciplinary endeavor. The biotech industry is establishing itself as the discovery arm of the pharmaceutical industry. In bridging the gap between academia and large pharmaceutical companies, the biotech firms have been effective instruments of technology transfer.},

abstract = {Molecular docking programs are widely used modeling tools for predicting ligand binding modes and structure based virtual screening. In this study, six molecular docking programs (DOCK, FlexX, GLIDE, ICM, PhDOCK, and Surflex) were evaluated using metrics intended to assess docking pose and virtual screening accuracy. Cognate ligand docking to 68 diverse, high-resolution X-ray complexes revealed that ICM, GLIDE, and Surflex generated ligand poses close to the X-ray conformation more often than the other docking programs. GLIDE and Surflex also outperformed the other docking programs when used for virtual screening, based on mean ROC AUC and ROC enrichment values obtained for the 40 protein targets in the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD). Further analysis uncovered general trends in accuracy that are specific for particular protein families. Modifying basic parameters in the software was shown to have a significant effect on docking and virtual screening results, suggesting that expert knowledge is critical for optimizing the accuracy of these methods.},

We investigate a generalization of SyCLoP in which the high-

manually-chosen projection to demonstrate that projections
other than the workspace can potentially work well. We then
evaluate SyCLoP{\textquoteright}s performance with random projections and
projections determined from linear dimensionality reduction
over elements of the state space, for which the results are
mixed. As we will see, finding a useful projection is a difficult
problem, and we conclude this paper by discussing the merits

Importantly, not all questions about a protein system require full space and time resolution to produce an informative answer.

The purpose of this review is to highlight the growing body of complementary work that goes beyond simulation. In particular, this review focuses on methods that address kinematics and dynamics, as well as those that address larger organizational questions and can quickly yield useful information about the long-timescale behavior of a protein.},

If the robots have to respect second-order dynamics, this becomes a challenging problem, even for static environments. This work presents a replanning framework where each robot computes partial plans during each cycle, while executing a previously computed trajectory.  Each robot communicates with its neighbors to select a trajectory that is safe over an infinite time horizon. The proposed approach does not require synchronization and allows the robots to dynamically change their cycles over time. This paper proves that the proposed motion coordination algorithm guarantees safety under this general setting. This framework is not specific to the underlying robot dynamics, as it can be used with a variety of dynamical systems, nor to the planning or control algorithm used to generate the robot trajectories. The performance of the approach is evaluated using a distributed multi-robot simulator on a computing cluster, where the simulated robots are forced to communicate by exchanging messages. The simulation results confirm the safety of the algorithm in various environments with up to 32 robots governed by second-order dynamics.},

	abstract = {In search and rescue applications it is important that mobile ground robots can verify whether a potential target/victim is indeed a target of interest. This paper describes a novel approach to multi-robot target verification of multiple static objects. Suppose a team of multiple mobile ground robots are operating in a partially known environment with knowledge of possible target locations and obstacles. The ground robots{\textquoteright} goal is to (a) collectively classify the targets (or build models of them) by identifying good viewpoints to sense the targets, while (b) coordinating their actions to execute the mission and always be safe by avoiding obstacles and each other. As opposed to a traditional next-best-view (NBV) algorithm that generates a single good view, we characterize the informativeness of all potential views. We propose a measure for the informativeness of a view that exploits the geometric structure of the pose manifold. This information is encoded in a cost map that guides a multi-robot motion planning algorithm towards views that are both reachable and informative. Finally, we account for differential constraints in the robots{\textquoteright} motion that prevent unrealistic scenarios such as the robots stopping or turning instantaneously. A range of simulations indicates that our approach outperforms current approaches and demonstrates the advantages of predictive sensing and accounting for reachability constraints.},

	abstract = {This paper studies a core problem in multi-objective mission planning for robots governed by differential constraints. The problem considered is the following. A car-like robot computes a plan to move from a start configuration to a goal region. The robot is equipped with a sensor that can alert it if an anomaly appears within some range while the robot is moving. In that case, the robot tries to deviate from its computed path and gather more information about the target without incurring considerable delays in fulfilling its primary mission, which is to move to its final destination. This problem is important in, e.g., surveillance, where inspection of possible threats needs to be balanced with completing a nominal route. The paper presents a simple and intuitive framework to study the trade-offs present in the above problem. Our work utilizes a state-of-the-art sampling-based planner, which employs both a high-level discrete guide and low-level planning. We show that modifications to the distance function used by the planner and to the weights that the planner employs to compute the high-level guide can help the robot react online to new secondary objectives that were unknown at the outset of the mission. The modifications are computed using information obtained from a conventional camera model. We find that for small percentage increases in path length, the robot can achieve significant gains in information about an unexpected target.},

	abstract = {A pharmaceutical drug compound is usually a small organic molecule, also termed as ligand, that binds to the target protein and alters the natural activity of the protein, thus, leading to a therapeutic effect. Computational docking or computer-aided docking is an extremely useful tool to gain an understanding of protein-ligand interactions which is important for the drug discovery. Computational docking is the process of computationally predicting the placement and binding affinity of the ligand in the binding pocket of the protein. Docking methods rely on a search algorithm which computes the placement of the ligand in the binding pocket and a scoring function which estimates the binding affinity, i.e., how strongly the ligand interacts with the protein. A variety of methods have been developed to solve the computational docking problems that range from simple point-matching algorithms to explicit physical simulation methods.

While branched metabolic pathways predominate in metabolic networks, most previous work has focused on identifying linear metabolic pathways. The ability to automatically identify branched pathways is important in applications that require a deeper understanding of metabolism, such as metabolic engineering and drug target identification. The algorithm presented in this article utilizes explicit atom tracking to identify linear metabolic pathways and then merges them together into branched metabolic pathways. We provide results on several well-characterized metabolic pathways that demonstrate that the new merging approach can efficiently find biologically relevant branched metabolic pathways.},

	abstract = {Signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (Stat3) plays a role in human cancers. One of the main approaches towards inhibiting its activity is the development of phosphopetides or peptidomimetics that competitively bind to the SH2 domain of Stat3. This work reports, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational molecular docking study to model all of the 142 peptidomimetics that mimic the Stat3 inhibitory pTyr-X-X-Glu motif. We used the docking  programs AUTODOCK and VINA to model SH2 domain-peptidomimetic complexes and estimate their binding affinities. We obtained better  screening accuracy using AUTODOCK which ranked the most potent inhibitor as second highest. Experimental binding energy values and scores from docking programs correlated poorly, confirming the limitations of many current docking programs when dealing with ligands that have a large number of rotatable bonds. Nevertheless, for close to 65\% of peptidomimetics, the structures of complexes computed by AUTODOCK are in agreement with current understanding of the structures. Modeling of the SH2 domain-peptidomimetic complexes is essential to better understand and design drug compounds for curing cancer. Our study is an important first step forward towards that goal.},

	abstract = {As robots become more versatile, they are increasingly found to operate together in the same environment where they must coordinate their motion in a distributed manner. Such operation does not present problems if the motion is quasi-static and collisions can be easily avoided. However, when the robots follow second-order dynamics, the problem becomes challenging even for a known environment. The setup in this work considers that each robot replans its own trajectory for the next replanning cycle. The planning process must guarantee the robot{\textquoteright}s safety by ensuring collision-free paths for the considered period and by not bringing the robot to states where collisions cannot be avoided in the future. This problem can be addressed through communication among the robots, but it becomes complicated when the replanning cycles of the different robots are not synchronized and the robots make planning decisions at different time instants. This paper shows how to guarantee the safe operation of multiple communicating second-order vehicles, whose replanning cycles do not coincide, through an asynchronous, distributed motion planning framework. The method is evaluated through simulations, where each robot is simulated on a different processor and communicates with its neighbors through message passing. The simulations confirm that the approach provides safety in scenarios with up to 48 robots with second-order dynamics in environments with obstacles, where collisions occur often without a safety framework.},

These complex pathways are called branched pathways because they can arrive at a target compound through combinations of pathways that split compounds into smaller ones, work in parallel with many compounds, and join compounds into larger ones. While most previous work has focused on identifying linear metabolic pathways, branched metabolic pathways predominate in metabolic networks. Automatic identification of branched pathways has a number of important applications in areas that require deeper understanding of metabolism, such as metabolic engineering and drug target identification. Our algorithm utilizes explicit atom tracking to identify linear metabolic pathways and then merges them together into branched metabolic pathways. We provide results on two well-characterized metabolic pathways that demonstrate that this new merging approach can efficiently find biologically relevant branched metabolic pathways with complex structures. },

A low-level sampling-based planner uses the physical model of the system, and the suggested high-level plans, to explore the state-space for feasible solutions.

We present a technique to construct the discrete abstraction using the geometry of the obstacles and the propositions defined over the workspace. Furthermore, we show through experiments that the use of geometry results in significant computational speedups compared to previous work.

The automatically recovered coordinates prove as excellent reaction coordinates for the molecules studied and can be used to identify stable states and transitions, and as a basis to build free-energy surfaces. The coordinates provide a better description of the free energy landscape when compared with coordinates computed using principal components analysis, the most popular linear dimensionality reduction technique.

	abstract = {Background
There is an increasing number of proteins with known structure but unknown function. Determining their function would have a significant impact on understanding diseases and designing new therapeutics. However, experimental protein function determination is expensive and very time-consuming. Computational methods can facilitate function determination by identifying proteins that have high structural and chemical similarity.

Results
We present LabelHash, a novel algorithm for matching substructural motifs to large collections of protein structures. The algorithm consists of two phases. In the first phase the proteins are preprocessed in a fashion that allows for instant lookup of partial matches to any motif. In the second phase, partial matches for a given motif are expanded to complete matches. The general applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated with three different case studies. First, we show that we can accurately identify members of the enolase superfamily with a single motif. Next, we demonstrate how LabelHash can complement SOIPPA, an algorithm for motif identification and pairwise substructure alignment. Finally, a large collection of Catalytic Site Atlas motifs is used to benchmark the performance of the algorithm. LabelHash runs very efficiently in parallel; matching a motif against all proteins in the 95\% sequence identity filtered non-redundant Protein Data Bank typically takes no more than a few minutes. The LabelHash algorithm is available through a web server and as a suite of standalone programs at http://labelhash.kavrakilab.org. The output of the LabelHash algorithm can be further analyzed with Chimera through a plugin that we developed for this purpose.

Conclusions
LabelHash is an efficient, versatile algorithm for large-scale substructure matching. When LabelHash is running in parallel, motifs can typically be matched against the entire PDB on the order of minutes. The algorithm is able to identify functional homologs beyond the twilight zone of sequence identity and even beyond fold similarity. The three case studies presented in this paper illustrate the versatility of the algorithm.},

A multilayered framework is presented which combines discrete search and sampling-based motion planning. This framework is called synergistic combination of layers of planning ( SyCLoP) hereafter. Discrete search uses a workspace decomposition to compute leads, i.e., sequences of regions in the neighborhood that guide sampling-based motion planning during the state-space exploration. In return, information gathered by motion planning, such as progress made, is fed back to the discrete search. This combination allows SyCLoP to identify new directions to lead the exploration toward the goal, making it possible to efficiently find solutions, even when other planners get stuck. Simulation experiments with dynamical models of ground and flying vehicles demonstrate that the combination of discrete search and motion planning in SyCLoP offers significant advantages. In fact, speedups of up to two orders of magnitude were obtained for all the sampling-based motion planners used as the continuous layer of SyCLoP.},

	pages = {242},
	abstract = {Background
Structural variations caused by a wide range of physicochemical and biological sources directly influence the function of a protein. For enzymatic proteins, the structure and chemistry of the catalytic binding site residues can be loosely defined as a substructure of the protein. Comparative analysis of drug-receptor substructures across and within species has been used for lead evaluation. Substructure-level similarity between the binding sites of functionally similar proteins has also been used to identify instances of convergent evolution among proteins. In functionally homologous protein families, shared chemistry and geometry at catalytic sites provide a common, local point of comparison among proteins that may differ significantly at the sequence, fold, or domain topology levels.

Results
This paper describes two key results that can be used separately or in combination for protein function analysis. The Family-wise Analysis of SubStructural Templates (FASST) method uses all-against-all substructure comparison to determine Substructural Clusters (SCs). SCs characterize the binding site substructural variation within a protein family. In this paper we focus on examples of automatically determined SCs that can be linked to phylogenetic distance between family members, segregation by conformation, and organization by homology among convergent protein lineages. The Motif Ensemble Statistical Hypothesis (MESH) framework constructs a representative motif for each protein cluster among the SCs determined by FASST to build motif ensembles that are shown through a series of function prediction experiments to improve the function prediction power of existing motifs.

Conclusions
FASST contributes a critical feedback and assessment step to existing binding site substructure identification methods and can be used for the thorough investigation of structure-function relationships. The application of MESH allows for an automated, statistically rigorous procedure for incorporating structural variation data into protein function prediction pipelines. Our work provides an unbiased, automated assessment of the structural variability of identified binding site substructures among protein structure families and a technique for exploring the relation of substructural variation to protein function. As available proteomic data continues to expand, the techniques proposed will be indispensable for the large-scale analysis and interpretation of structural data.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Finding novel or non-standard metabolic pathways, possibly spanning multiple species, has important applications in fields such as metabolic engineering, metabolic network analysis, and metabolic network reconstruction. Traditionally, this has been a manual process, but the large volume of metabolic data now available has created a need for computational tools to automatically identify biologically relevant pathways.

Results: We present new algorithms for finding metabolic pathways, given a desired start and target compound, that conserve a given number of atoms by tracking the movement of atoms through metabolic networks containing thousands of compounds and reactions. First, we describe an algorithm that identifies linear pathways. We then present a new algorithm for finding branched metabolic pathways. Comparisons to known metabolic pathways demonstrate that atom tracking enables our algorithms to avoid many unrealistic connections, often found in previous approaches, and return biologically meaningful pathways. Our results also demonstrate the potential of the algorithms to find novel or non-standard pathways that may span multiple organisms.

A high-level planner uses a user-defined discrete abstraction of the hybrid system as well as exploration information to suggest high-level plans.

In our previous work, we have proposed a geometry-based approach for the construction of the discrete abstraction for the case when the robot is modeled as a continuous system. Here, we extend the approach for the construction of the discrete abstraction to the case when the robot is modeled as nonlinear hybrid system. To use the resulting abstraction more efficiently, we also propose a lazy-search  approach for high-level planning that reduces the size of the search space by reusing previously constructed high-level plans for initializing the search. The new techniques are tested experimentally for second-order nonlinear hybrid robot models in challenging workspace environments with obstacles and for a variety of temporal logic specifications.

Results: In this work we investigate the application of a robotics-inspired method, using backbone and limited side chain representation and a coarse grained energy function to trace large-scale conformational motions. We tested the algorithm on four well known medium to large proteins and we show that even with relatively little information we are able to trace low-energy conformational pathways efficiently. The conformational pathways produced by our methods can be further filtered and refined to produce more useful information on the way proteins function under physiological conditions.

Conclusions: The proposed method effectively captures large-scale conformational changes and produces pathways that are consistent with experimental data and other computational studies.

The method efficiently obtains a large set of equilibrium conformations in two stages: first exploring the entire space at a coarse-grained level of detail, then narrowing a refined exploration to selected low-energy regions. The coarse-grained exploration periodically adds all-atom detail to selected conformations to ensure that the search leads to regions which maintain low energies in all-atom detail. The second stage reconstructs selected low-energy coarse-grained conformations in all-atom detail. A low-dimensional energy landscape associated with all-atom conformations allows focusing the exploration to energy minima and their conformational ensembles. The lowest energy ensembles are enriched with additional all-atom conformations through further multiscale exploration. The lowest energy ensembles obtained from the application of the method to three different proteins correctly capture the known functional states of the considered systems.},

A challenging aspect of this problem is how to utilize communication so that vehicles do not reach states from which collisions cannot be avoided due to second-order motion constraints. This paper initially shows how it is possible to provide theoretical safety guarantees with a priority-based coordination scheme. Safety means avoiding collisions with obstacles and between vehicles. This notion is also extended to include the retainment of a communication network when the vehicles operate as a networked team. The paper then progresses to extend this safety framework into a fully distributed communication protocol for real-time planning. The proposed algorithm integrates sampling-based motion planners with message-passing protocols for distributed constraint optimization. Each vehicle uses the motion planner to generate candidate feasible trajectories and the message-passing protocol for selecting a safe and compatible trajectory. The existence of such trajectories is guaranteed by the overall approach. The theoretical results have also been experimentally confirmed with a distributed simulator built on a cluster of processors and using applications such as coordinated exploration. Furthermore, experiments show that the distributed protocol has better scalability properties when compared against the priority-based scheme.},

               continuous eXploration (DSLX) planner, a multi-resolution
               approach to motion planning that is suitable for challenging
               problems involving robots with kinodynamic constraints. Initially
               the method decomposes the workspace to build a graph that
               encodes the physical adjacency of the decomposed regions. This
               graph is searched to obtain leads, that is, sequences of regions that
               can be explored with sampling-based tree methods to generate
               solution trajectories. Instead of treating the discrete search of
               the adjacency graph and the exploration of the continuous state
               space as separate components, DSLX passes information from
               one to the other in innovative ways. Each lead suggests what
               regions to explore and the exploration feeds back information
               to the discrete search to improve the quality of future leads.
               Information is encoded in edge weights, which indicate the
               importance of including the regions associated with an edge in
               the next exploration step. Computation of weights, leads, and the
               actual exploration make the core loop of the algorithm.

               Extensive experimentation shows that DSLX is very versatile.
               The discrete search can drastically change the lead to reflect
               new information allowing DSLX to find solutions even when
               sampling-based tree planners get stuck. Experimental results on

	abstract = {Many pathogens target the complement system as part of their strategy of escaping the immune system. In this context, the extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein (Efb) and the Staphylococcal complement inhibitor (SCIN) from Staphylococcus aureus have been recognized as exceptionally potent complement inhibitors. While both proteins interfere at the level of C3 convertases, their molecular mechanisms and binding specificities are clearly distinct. In view of the increasingly problematic infections with S. aureus and the potential of microbial evasion proteins as templates for therapeutic complement inhibitors, more details about their mode of action are urgently needed.
Here we present extensive molecular studies on the structure, interaction properties and binding specificities of Efb, and show that its target spectrum is far greater than initially expected. In particular, we found that its C-terminal domain (Efb-C) efficiently prevents the interaction of C3d with complement receptor 2 and therefore may have direct consequences for the bridging to adaptive immune responses. Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we confirmed the induction of conformational changes in C3 upon binding of Efb-C and demonstrate that such changes may significantly alter the interaction pattern of C3b with a number of ligands and regulators. Furthermore, we extended our characterization of the binding interface between Efb-C and C3d based on structural, biophysical, and computational methods, which identified additional key residues and showed that this important interaction is largely driven by electrostatic forces.
Finally, we show that SCIN not only interacts with the assembled C3 convertase but also directly binds to C3b at an area distant from the Efb-C binding site. Biophysical experiments confirmed that SCIN stabilizes the C3 convertase and indicate that the inhibitor prevents cleavage but not the initial binding of native C3 to the convertase.

	address = {Houston, TX},
	abstract = {A significant challenge of autonomous robotics in transportation, exploration, and search-and-rescue missions lies in the area of motion planning. The overall objective is to enable robots to automatically plan the low-level motions needed to accomplish assigned high-level tasks. Toward this goal, this thesis proposes a novel multi-layered approach, termed Synergic Combination of Layers of Planning (SyCLoP), that synergically combines high- level discrete planning and low-level motion planning. High-level discrete planning, which draws from research in AI and logic, guides low-level motion planning during the search for a solution. Information gathered during the search is in turn fed back from the low-level to the high-level layer in order to improve the high-level plan in the next iteration. In this way, high-level plans become increasingly useful in guiding the low-level motion planner toward a solution. This synergic combination of high-level discrete planning and low-level motion planning allows SyCLoP to solve motion-planning problems with respect to rich models of the robot and the physical world. This facilitates the design of feedback controllers that enable the robot to execute in the physical world solutions obtained in simulation. In particular, SyCLoP effectively solves challenging motion-planning problems that incorporate robot dynamics, physics-based simulations, and hybrid systems. Hybrid systems move beyond continuous models by employing discrete logic to instantaneously modify the underlying robot dynamics to respond to mishaps or unanticipated changes in the environment. Experiments in this thesis show that SyCLoP obtains significant computational speedup of one to two orders of magnitude when compared to state-of-the-art motion planners. In addition to planning motions that allow the robot to reach a desired destination while avoiding collisions, SyCLoP can take into account high-level tasks specified using the expressiveness of linear temporal logic (LTL). {LTL} allows for complex specifications, such as sequencing, coverage, and other combinations of temporal objectives. Going beyond motion planning, SyCLoP also provides a useful framework for discovering violations of safety properties in hybrid systems.},

	address = {Houston, TX},
	abstract = {Motion planning is a fundamental algorithmic problem that attracts attention because of its importance in many exciting applications, such as controlling robots or virtual agents in simulations and computer games. While there has been great progress over the last decades in solving high-dimensional geometric problems there are still many challenges that limit the capabilities of existing solutions. In particular, it is important to effectively model and plan for systems with complex dynamics and significant drift (kinodynamic planning). An additional requirement is that realistic systems and agents must safely operate in a real-time fashion (replanning), with partial knowledge of their surroundings (partial observability) and despite the presence or in collaboration with other moving agents (distributed planning). This thesis describes techniques that address challenges related to real-time motion planning while focusing on systems with non-trivial dynamics. The first contribution is a new kinodynamic planner, termed Informed Subdivision Tree (IST), that incorporates heuristics to solve motion planning queries more effectively while achieving the theoretical guarantee of probabilistic completeness. The thesis proposes also a general methodology to construct heuristics for kinodynamic planning based on configuration space knowledge through a roadmap-based approach. Then this thesis investigates replanning problems, where a planner is called periodically given a predefined amount of time. In this scenario, safety concerns arise by the presence of both dynamic motion constraints and time limitations. The thesis proposes the framework of Short-Term Safety Replanning (STSR), which achieves safety guarantees in this context while minimizing computational overhead. The final contribution corresponds to an extension of the STSR framework in distributed planning, where multiple agents communicate to safely avoid collisions despite their dynamic constraints. The proposed algorithms are tested on simulated systems with interesting dynamics, including physically simulated systems. Such experiments correspond to the state-of-the-art in terms of system modeling for motion planning. The experiments show that the proposed techniques outperform existing alternatives, where available, and emphasize their computational advantages.},

	year = {2008},
	school = {Rice University},
	address = {Houston, TX},
	abstract = {Growing databases of protein sequences in the post-genomic era call for computational methods to extract structure and function from a protein sequence. In flexible molecules like proteins, function cannot be reliably extracted from a few structures. The amino-acid chain assumes various spatial arrangements (conformations) to modulate biological function. Characterizing the flexibility of a protein under physiological (native) conditions remains an open problem in computational biology. This thesis addresses the problem of characterizing the native flexibility of a protein by computing conformations populated under native conditions. Such computation involves locating free-energy minima in a high-dimensional conformational space. The methods proposed in this thesis search for native conformations using systematically less information from experiment: first employing an experimental structure, then using only a closure constraint in cyclic cysteine-rich peptides, and finally employing only the amino-acid sequence of small- to medium-size proteins. A novel method is proposed to compute structural fluctuations of a protein around an experimental structure. The method combines a robotics-inspired exploration of the conformational space with a statistical mechanics formulation. Thermodynamic quantities measured over generated conformations reproduce experimental data of broad time scales on small (\~{} 100 amino acids) proteins with non-concerted motions. Capturing concerted motions motivates the development of the next methods. A second method is proposed that employs a closure constraint to generate native conformations of cyclic cysteine-rich peptides. The method first explores the entire conformational space, then explores in present energy minima until no lower-energy minima emerge. The method captures relevant features of the native state also observed in experiment for 20 - 30 amino-acid long peptides. A final method is proposed that implements a similar exploration but for longer proteins and employing only amino-acid sequence. In its first stage, the method explores the entire conformational space at a coarse-grained level of detail. A second stage focuses the exploration to low-energy regions in more detail. All-atom conformational ensembles are obtained for proteins that populate various functional states through large-scale concerted motions. These ensembles capture well the populated functional states of proteins up to 214 amino-acids long.},

	title = {Prediction of enzyme function based on 3D templates of evolutionarily important amino acids},
	journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
	volume = {9},
	year = {2008},
	abstract = {Background:
Structural genomics projects such as the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) yield many new 
structures, but often these have no known molecular functions. One approach to recover this 
information is to use 3D templates{\textemdash}structure-function motifs that consist of a few functionally 
critical amino acids and may suggest functional similarity when geometrically matched to other 
structures. Since experimentally determined functional sites are not common enough to define 
3D templates on a large scale, this work tests a computational strategy to select relevant residues 
for 3 emplates. 

Results:
Based on evolutionary information and heuristics, an Evolutionary Trace Annotation (ETA) 
pipeline built templates for 98 enzymes, half taken from the PSI, and sought matches in a non- 
redundant structure database. On average each template matched 2.7 distinct proteins, of which 
2.0 share the first three Enzyme Commission digits as the template{\textquoteright}s enzyme of origin. In many 
cases (61\%) a single most likely function could be predicted as the annotation with the most 
matches, and in these cases such a plurality vote identified the correct function with 87\% 
accuracy. ETA was also found to be complementary to sequence homology-based annotations. 
When matches are required to both geometrically match the 3D template and to be sequence 
homologs found by BLAST or PSI-BLAST, the annotation accuracy is greater than either 
method alone, especially in the region of lower sequence identity where homology-based 
annotations re east eliable. 

Conclusions:
These data suggest that knowledge of evolutionarily important residues improves functional 
annotation among distant enzyme homologs. Since, unlike other 3D template approaches, the 
ETA method bypasses the need for experimental knowledge of the catalytic mechanism, it 
should prove a useful, large scale, and general adjunct to combine with other methods to

The robot is guided to the goal by a navigation function which is constantly updated to ensure the robot can explore all of its workspace. Experiments on various systems and workspaces show that the proposed approach can solve harder problems and produce paths of shorter duration compared to state-of-the art offline planners using only bounded memory.},

	abstract = {The identification of protein function is crucial to understanding cellular processes and selecting novel proteins as drug targets. However, experimental methods for determining protein function can be expensive and time-consuming. Protein partial structure comparison methods seek to guide and accelerate the process of function determination by matching characterized functional site representations, motifs, to substructures within uncharacterized proteins, matches. One common difficulty of all protein structural comparison techniques is the computational cost of obtaining a match. In an effort to maintain practical efficiency, some algorithms employ efficient geometric threshold-based searches to eliminate biologically irrelevant matches. Thresholds refine and accelerate the method by limiting the number of potential matches that need to be considered. However, because statistical models rely on the output of the geometric matching method to accurately measure statistical significance, geometric thresholds can also artificially distort the basis of statistical models, making statistical scores dependant on geometric thresholds and potentially causing significant reductions in accuracy of the functional annotation method. This paper proposes a point-weight based correction approach to quantify and model the dependence of statistical scores to account for the systematic bias introduced by heuristics. Using a benchmark dataset of 20 structural motifs, we show that the point-weight correction procedure accurately models the information lost during the geometric comparison phase, removing systematic bias and greatly reducing misclassification rates of functionally related proteins, while maintaining specificity.

The method uses minimal information, namely, amino acid sequence and cyclization, as a topological feature that characterizes the native state. The method does not assume a specific disulfide bond pairing for cysteines and allows the possibility of unpaired cysteines. A detailed view of the conformational space relevant for the native state is obtained through a hierarchic multi-resolution exploration. A crucial feature of the exploration is a geometric approach that efficiently generates a large number of distinct cyclic conformations independently of one another. A spatial and energetic analysis of the generated conformations associates a free-energy landscape to the explored conformational space. Application to three long cyclic peptides of different folds shows that the conformational ensembles and cysteine arrangements associated with free energy minima are fully consistent with available experimental data. The results provide a detailed analysis of the native state features of cyclic peptides that can be further tested in experiment.},

                of this problem is how to utilize communication so
                that vehicles do not reach states from which
                collisions cannot be avoided due to second-order
                motion constraints. This paper provides a distributed
                communication protocol for real-time planning that
                guarantees collision avoidance with obstacles and
                between vehicles. It can also allow the retainment of
                a communication network when the vehicles operate as a
                networked team. The algorithm is a novel integration

Because simulated molecular samples are very high-dimensional, it is important to classify them using very few parameters. Traditionally, this requires empirical reaction coordinates to be devised by an expert. This work, in contrast, automates the classification by applying an algorithmic tool for non-linear dimensionality reduction, called ScIMAP, that requires minimal user intervention. A comparison with the most popular linear dimensionality reduction technique, Principal Components Analysis, shows how non-linearity is crucial for capturing the main motion parameters. The contribution is validated by several results on increasingly complex systems, ranging from the motion of small peptides to the folding of large proteins. In all cases, only 1{\textendash}3 parameters are sufficient to characterize the motion landscape and prove as excellent reaction coordinates.},

These motif matching algorithms identify matches of geometric and chemical similarity between well-studied functional sites, motifs, and substructures of functionally uncharacterized proteins, targets. For the purpose of function prediction, the accuracy of motif matching algorithms can be evaluated with the number of statistically significant matches to functionally related proteins, true positives (TPs), and the number of statistically insignificant matches to functionally unrelated proteins, false positives (FPs). Our earlier work developed cavity-aware motifs which use motif points to represent functionally significant atoms and C-spheres to represent functionally significant volumes. We observed that cavity-aware motifs match significantly fewer FPs than matches containing only motif points. We also observed that high-impact C-spheres, which significantly contribute to the reduction of FPs, can be isolated automatically with a technique we call Cavity Scaling. This paper extends our earlier work by demonstrating that C-spheres can be used to accelerate point-based geometric and chemical comparison algorithms, maintaining accuracy while reducing runtime. We also demonstrate that the placement of C-spheres can significantly affect the number of TPs and FPs identified by a cavity-aware motif. While the optimal placement of C-spheres remains a diffcult open problem, we compared two logical placement strategies to better understand C-sphere placement. },

	abstract = {The study of disease often hinges on the biological function of proteins, but determining protein function is a difficult experimental process. To minimize duplicated effort, algorithms for function prediction seek characteristics indicative of possible protein function. One approach is to identify substructural matches of geometric and chemical similarity between motifs representing known active sites and target protein structures with unknown function. In earlier work, statistically significant matches of certain effective motifs have identified functionally related active sites. Effective motifs must be carefully designed to maintain similarity to functionally related sites (sensitivity) and avoid incidental similarities to functionally unrelated protein geometry (specificity). Existing techniques design motifs using the geometry of a single protein structure. Poor selection of this structure can limit motif effectiveness if the selected functional site lacks similarity to functionally related sites. To address this problem, this paper presents composite motifs, which combine structures of functionally related active sites to potentially increase sensitivity. Our experimentation compares the effectiveness of composite motifs with simple motifs designed from single protein structures. On six distinct families of functionally related proteins, leave-one-out testing showed that composite motifs had sensitivity comparable to the most sensitive of all simple motifs and specificity comparable to the average simple motif. On our data set, we observed that composite motifs simultaneously capture variations in active site conformation, diminish the problem of selecting motif structures, and enable the fusion of protein structures from diverse data sources.

Resolving these issues depends partially on a thorough understanding of the biological function of proteins. Unfortunately, the experimental determination of protein function is expensive and time consuming. To support and accelerate the determination of protein functions, algorithms for function prediction are designed to gather evidence indicating functional similarity with well studied proteins. One such approach is the MASH pipeline, described in the first half of this paper. MASH identifies matches of geometric and chemical similarity between motifs, representing known functional sites, and substructures of functionally uncharacterized proteins (targets). Observations from several research groups concur that statistically significant matches can indicate functionally related active sites.

One major subproblem is the design of effective motifs, which have many matches to functionally related targets (sensitive motifs), and few matches to functionally unrelated targets (specific motifs). Current techniques select and combine structural, physical, and evolutionary properties to generate motifs that mirror functional characteristics in active sites. This approach ignores incidental similarities that may occur with functionally unrelated proteins. To address this problem, we have developed Geometric Sieving (GS), a parallel distributed algorithm that efficiently refines motifs, designed by existing methods, into optimized motifs with maximal geometric and chemical dissimilarity from all known protein structures. In exhaustive comparison of all possible motifs based on the active sites of 10 well-studied proteins, we observed that optimized motifs were among the most sensitive and specific.

               expected to carry out underscores the need for the development of
               motion planners that can take into account discrete changes in the
               continuous motions of the system. Completion of tasks such as
               exploration of unknown or hazardous environments often requires
               discrete changes in the controls and motions of the robot in order to
               adapt to different terrains or maintain operability during partial
               failures or other mishaps.
               The contribution of this work toward this objective is the development
               of an efficient motion planner for a hybrid robotic system. The
               controls and motion equations of the robot could change discretely in
               order to enable the robot to operate in different terrains. The
               framework in this paper blends discrete searching with sampling-based
               motion planning for continuous state spaces and is well-suited for
               robotic systems modeled as hybrid systems with numerous discrete modes

Applications of this method to proteins of various folds and sizes show that thermodynamic observables measured as averages over the native state ensembles obtained by the method agree remarkably well with nuclear magnetic resonance data that span multiple timescales.

PEM models global equilibrium fluctuations of a polypeptide chain by combining local fluctuations of consecutive overlapping fragments of the chain. Local fluctuations are computed by a probabilistic exploration that exploits analogies between proteins and robots. All generated conformations are subjected to energy minimization and then are weighted according to a Boltzmann distribution. Using the theory of statistical mechanics the Boltzmann-weighted fluctuations corresponding to each fragment are combined to obtain fluctuations for the entire protein. The agreement obtained between PEM-modeled fluctuations, wet-lab experiment and guided simulation measurements, indicates that PEM is able to reproduce with high accuracy protein equilibrium fluctuations that occur over a broad range of timescales.},

We validate the usefulness of this method by characterizing the folding landscape associated with a coarse-grained protein model of src homology 3 as sampled by molecular dynamics simulations. The folding free-energy landscape projected on the few relevant coordinates emerging from the dimensionality reduction can correctly identify the transition-state ensemble of the reaction. The first embedding dimension efficiently captures the evolution of the folding process along the main folding route. These results clearly show that the proposed method can efficiently find a low-dimensional representation of a complex process such as protein folding.},

Unfortunately, experimental determination of protein function is expensive and time consuming. For this reason, algorithms for computational function prediction have been developed to focus and accelerate this effort. These algorithms are comparison techniques which identify matches of geometric and chemical similarity between motifs, representing known functional sites, and substructures of functionally uncharacterized proteins (targets). Matches of statistically significant geometric and chemical similarity can identify targets with active sites cognate to the matching motif. Unfortunately statistically significant matches can include false positive matches to functionally unrelated proteins. We target this problem by presenting Cavity Aware Match Augmentation (CAMA), a technique which uses C-spheres to represent active clefts which must remain vacant for ligand binding. CAMA rejects matches to targets without similar binding volumes. On 18 sample motifs, we observed that introducing C-spheres eliminated 80\% of false positive matches and maintained 87\% of true positive matches found with identical motifs lacking C-spheres. Analyzing a range of C-sphere positions and sizes, we observed that some high-impact C- spheres eliminate more false positive matches than others. High-impact C-spheres can be detected with a geometric analysis we call Cavity Scaling, permitting us to refine our initial cavity-aware motifs to contain only high-impact C-spheres. In the absence of expert knowledge, Cavity Scaling can guide the design of cavity-aware motifs to eliminate many false positive matches.},

	abstract = {Determining the function of all proteins is a recurring theme in modern biology and medicine, but the sheer number of proteins makes experimental approaches impractical. For this reason, current efforts have considered in silico function prediction in order to guide and accelerate the function determination process. One approach to predicting protein function is to search functionally uncharacterized protein structures (targets), for substructures with geometric and chemical similarity (matches), to known active sites (motifs). Finding a match can imply that the target has an active site similar to the motif, suggesting functional homology. 

An effective function predictor requires effective motifs - motifs whose geometric and chemical characteristics are detected by comparison algorithms within functionally homologous targets (sensitive motifs), which also are not detected within functionally unrelated targets (specific motifs). Designing effective motifs is a difficult open problem. Current approaches select and combine structural, physical, and evolutionary properties to design motifs that mirror functional characteristics of active sites. 

We present a new approach, Geometric Sieving (GS), which refines candidate motifs into optimized motifs with maximal geometric and chemical dissimilarity from all known protein structures. The paper discusses both the usefulness and the efficiency of GS. We show that candidate motifs from six well-studied proteins, including alpha-Chymotrypsin, Dihydrofolate Reductase, and Lysozyme, can be optimized with GS to motifs that are among the most sensitive and specific motifs possible for the candidate motifs. For the same proteins, we also report results that relate evolutionarily important motifs with motifs that exhibit maximal geometric and chemical dissimilarity from all known protein structures. Our current observations show that GS is a powerful tool that can complement existing work on motif design and protein function prediction. },

techniques for mobile robot navigation that have minimum perceptual
requirements. In this work, we focus on robot navigation algorithms
that do not require range information or metric maps of the

enables a robot to return to its home position after executing a long
path. The proposed strategy relies on measuring the angle between
pairs of features extracted from panoramic images, which can be
achieved accurately and robustly.  In the heart of the proposed homing
strategy lies a novel, local control law that enables a robot to reach
any position on the plane by exploiting the bearings of at least three
landmarks of unknown position, without making assumptions regarding
the robot{\textquoteright}s orientation and without making use of a compass.  This
control law is the result of the unification of two other local
control laws which guide the robot by monitoring the bearing of
landmarks and which are able to reach complementary sets of goal
positions on the plane. Long-range homing is then realized through the
systematic application of the unified control law between
automatically extracted milestone positions connecting the robot{\textquoteright}s
current position to the home position.  Experimental results,
conducted both in a simulated environment and on a robotic platform
equipped with a panoramic camera validate the employed local control
laws as well as the overall homing strategy. Moreover, they show that
panoramic vision can assist in simplifying the perceptual processes
required to support robust and accurate homing behaviors.},

This paper presents a Fragment Ensemble Method to capture the mobility of a protein fragment such as a missing loop and its extension into a Protein Ensemble Method to characterize the mobility of an entire protein at equilibrium. The underlying approach in both methods is to combine a geometric exploration of conformational space with a statistical mechanics formulation to generate an ensemble of physical conformations on which thermodynamic quantities can be measured as ensemble averages. The Fragment Ensemble Method is validated by applying it to characterize loop mobility in both instances of strongly stable and disordered loop fragments. In each instance, fluctuations measured over generated ensembles are consistent with data from experiment and simulation. The Protein Ensemble Method captures the mobility of an entire protein by generating and combining ensembles of conformations for consecutive overlapping fragments defined over the protein sequence. This method is validated by applying it to characterize flexibility in ubiquitin and protein G. Thermodynamic quantities measured over the ensembles generated for both proteins are fully consistent with available experimental data. On these proteins, the method recovers nontrivial data such as order parameters, residual dipolar couplings, and scalar couplings. Results presented in this work suggest that the proposed methods can provide insight into the interplay between protein flexibility and function.},

developing planning algorithms which are effective for solving

Various applications in robotics and in other fields demand
additional physical realism. Some progress has been made for
non-holonomic systems. However systems with significant drift,
underactuation and discrete system changes remain challenging
for existing planning techniques particularly as the dimensionality
of the state space increases. In this paper, we demonstrate a
motion planning technique for the solution of problems with these
challenging characteristics. Our approach uses sampling-based
motion planning and subdivision methods. The problem that we
solve is a game that was chosen to exemplify characteristics
of dynamical systems that are difficult for planning. To our
knowledge, this is first application of algorithmic motion planning
to a problem of this type and complexity.},

  analysis of a system for determining position inside a building from
  measured RF signal strengths of packets on an IEEE 802.11b wireless
  Ethernet network. Previous approaches to location-awareness with RF
  signals have been severely hampered by non-Gaussian signals, noise,
  and complex correlations due to multi-path effects, interference and
  absorption. The design of our system begins with the observation
  that determining position from complex, noisy and non-Gaussian
  signals is a wellstudied problem in the field of robotics. Using
  only off-the-shelf hardware, we achieve robust position estimation
  to within a meter in our experimental context and after adequate
  training of our system. We can also coarsely determine our
  orientation and can track our position as we move. Our results show
  that we can localize a stationary device to within 1.5 meters over
  80\% of the time and track a moving device to within 1 meter over
  50\% of the time. Both localization and tracking run in
  real-time. By applying recent advances in probabilistic inference of

It is a sampling-based method which builds a tree and takes a substantially different approach from other exploration planners such as RRT [18] and EST [12]. PDST-EXPLORE is a general purpose planner but is designed to overcome difficulties inherent in planning for robots with non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, our planner represents samples as path segments rather than individual states and uses non-uniform subdivisions of the state space to estimate coverage. This change avoids many of the problems that previous sampling-based planners have had with milestone placement, metrics and coverage estimation. We use a deterministic update schedule together with randomized path generation to adaptively strike a balance between greedy exploration and methodical search. We have obtained a proof of probabilistic completeness for the planner which assumes very little about the specific robot system that the planner operates on. Finally, we have implemented the planner for planar kinodynamic point robots, differential drive robots and blimp-like robots. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the planner{\textquoteright}s implementation as well as its robustness in covering the entire reachable free space.

Favorable conformations of the ligands that successfully bind with receptors are sought to form stable ligand{\textendash}receptor complexes. Usually a large number of conformations are generated and their binding energies are examined. We propose adding a geometric screening phase before an energy minimization procedure so that only conformations that geometrically fit in the binding site will be prompted for energy calculation.

Results: Geometric screening can drastically reduce the number of conformations to be examined from millions (or higher) to thousands (or lower). The method can also handle cases when there are more variables than geometric constraints. An early-stage implementation is able to finish the geometric filtering of conformations for molecules with up to nine variables in 1 min. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such results are reported deterministically.},

  multiple queries for motion planning problems with single query
  planners in a motion planning framework that can be efficiently

  built during a preprocessing phase in order to quickly respond to
  on-line queries. Alternatively, in single query planning, there is
  no preprocessing phase and all computations occur during query
  resolution. This paper shows how to effectively combine a powerful
  sample-based method primarily designed for multiple query planning
  (the Probabilistic Roadmap Method - PRM) with sample-based tree
  methods that were primarily designed for single query planning (such
  as Expansive Space Trees, Rapidly Exploring Random Trees, and
  others). Our planner, which we call the Probabilistic Roadmap of
  Trees (PRT), uses a tree algorithm as a subroutine for PRM. The
  nodes of the PRM roadmap are now trees. We take advantage of the
  very powerful sampling schemes of recent tree planners to populate
  our roadmaps. The combined sampling scheme is in the spirit of the
  non-uniform sampling and refinement techniques employed in earlier
  work on PRM. PRT not only achieves a smooth spectrum between
  multiple query and single query planning but it combines advantages
  of both. We present experiments which show that PRT is capable of
  solving problems that cannot be addressed efficiently with PRM or
  single-query planners. A key advantage of PRT is that it is
  significantly more decoupled than PRM and sample-based tree
  planners. Using this property, we designed and implemented a
  parallel version of PRT. Our experiments show that PRT distributes

We actually collected over two minutes of data per office or region, about 28 man-hours of effort. Using less than half of this data to train the localizer, we can localize a user to the precise, correct location in over 95\% of our attempts, across the entire building. Even in the most pathological cases, we almost never localize a user any more distant than to the neighboring office. A user can obtain this level of accuracy with only two or three signal intensity measurements, allowing for a high frame rate of localization results. Furthermore, with a brief calibration period, our system can be adapted to work with previously unknown user hardware. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our system against a variety of untrained time-varying phenomena, including the presence or absence of people in the building across the day.

Knot untangling can be viewed as a   high-dimensional planning problem in reparametrizable configuration spaces. In the past, simulated annealing and other energy minimization methods have been   used to find knot untangling paths. We have developed a probabilistic planner that is capable of untangling knots described by over 400 variables. We have tested on known difficult benchmarks in this area and untangled them more quickly than has been achieved with minimization in the literature. In this work, the use of motion planning techniques is critical for the untangling. Our   planner defines local goals and makes combined use of energy minimization and randomized tree-based planning. We also show how to produce candidates with a   minimal number of segments for a given knot. The planner developed in this work is novel in that it is used to study issues arising in practical motion planning for high-dimensional and reparametrizable geometry. The use of energy methods, local goals and tree-based expansion is also novel and may suggest solutions in other planning applications. Finally, we discuss some possible applications of   our untangling planner in computational topology, in the study of DNA rings and protein folding and for planning with flexible robots.},

However, the exponential growth of sequence and structure data far exceeds the ability of experimental techniques to identify their locations and key amino acids. To fill this gap we developed a computational Evolutionary Trace method that ranks the evolutionary importance of amino acids in protein sequences. Studies show that the best-ranked residues form fewer and larger structural clusters than expected by chance and overlap with functional sites, but until now the significance of this overlap has remained qualitative. Here, we use 86 diverse protein structures, including 20 determined by the structural genomics initiative, to show that this overlap is a recurrent and statistically significant feature. An automated ET correctly identifies seven of ten functional sites by the least favorable statistical measure, and nine of ten by the most favorable one. These results quantitatively demonstrate that a large fraction of functional sites in the proteome may be accurately identified from sequence and structure. This should help focus structure{\textendash}function studies, rational drug design, protein engineering, and functional annotation to the relevant regions of a protein.},

of large databases of small chemical compounds is still an unsolved and hard problem.
The main reason behind this difficulty is the exponential explosion in computational
complexity due to the inclusion of the large number of degrees of freedom that represent
the receptor flexibility. In order to address this limitation several flexibility models for
the receptor have been developed which try to limit the number of additional model
parameters. These models can be roughly grouped divided into five different categories.
These are the use of soft receptors which relax energetic penalties due to steric clashes,
the selection of a few critical degrees of freedom in the receptor binding site, the use of
multiple receptor structures either individually or by combining them using an averaging
scheme, the use of modified molecular simulation methods, or the use of collective
degrees of freedom as a new basis of representation for protein flexibility. All these
flexible receptor models strive to balance an improvement in the accuracy of the docking
predictions with an increase in computational cost. In addition, other challenges such as
the development of accurate solvation models and scoring functions make the receptor
flexibility problem even harder.},

In this paper we discuss the following problem in molecular modeling: given a three-dimensional conformation of a molecule, how do we automatially compute the conformations of the molecule that satisfy certain spatial constraints, that is, certain "feature" atoms of the molecule are in user-specified positions? This task is important in the analysis of receptor-ligand interactions and in other applications such as drug design and protein folding. Using an analogy between robots and molecules, we use the term inverse kinematics to describe the above conformational problems. To solve these problems, we first derive a system of polynomial equations. Then, we adopt a technique based on the Groebner basis from algebraic geometry and develop a novel subdivision algorithm to approximate the real solutions. The approximated solutions can then be used as the starting conformations for existing (heuristic) energy minimization procedures that try to satisfy the target positions of feature atoms and reduce the overall energy of the conformation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a rigorous algebraic methodology has been used to approximate molecular inverse kinematics solutions.},

We first review two widely used methods for deriving molecular conformations, the simple rotations scheme and the Denavit-Hartenberg local frames method. We discuss their disadvantages which include extensive bookkeeping, accumulation of numerical errors, and redundancies in the local frames used. Then we introduce a new, fast, and accurate method called the atomgroup local frames method. This new method not only eliminates the disadvantages of earlier approaches but also provides lazy evaluation of atom positions and reduces the computational cost. Our method is especially useful in applications where many conformations are generated or updated such as in energy minimization and conformational search.},

In particular, we show that for a finite set of parts (with different shapes), we can specify a single field that can uniquely orient and position every part in the set.

Manipulation plans for these devices can therefore be considered as strategies for applying a sequence of fields to bring parts to some desired configurations. Typically, to uniquely orient and position a part, several fields have to be sequentially employed. Previously, it has been proven that there exists a combination of the unit radial field and a constant field that induces a unique stable equilibrium for almost any part. However, that work focuses mainly on an existential proof and fails to address how to compute the field for a given part. We propose a radically different field with a proof confirming that the field induces a unique stable equilibrium for almost any part. This proof leads us to a method for computing a single field for orienting a given part, together with the corresponding stable equilibrium configuration of the part.},

The prediction of the intermolecular complex is of vital importance for the development of new therapeutics as docking can alter the chemical behavior of the receptor macromolecule. We first present current methods for docking, which have several limitations. Some of these methods consider only the flexibility of the ligand solving a problem with a few tens of degrees of freedom. When the receptor flexibility is taken into account several hundreds or even thousands of degrees of freedom need to be considered. Most methods take into account only a small number of these degrees of freedom by using chemical knowledge specific to the problem. We show how to use a singular value decomposition of molecular dynamics trajectories to automatically obtain information about the global flexibility of the receptor and produce interesting conformations that can be used for docking purposes.},

	abstract = {In robotics, homing can be defined as that behavior which enables a robot to return to its initial (home) position, after traveling a certain distance along an arbitrary path. Odometry has traditionally been used for the implementation of such a behavior, but it has been shown to be an unreliable source of information. In this work, a novel method for visual homing is proposed, based on a panoramic camera. As the robot departs from its initial position, it tracks characteristic features of the environment (corners). As soon as homing is activated, the robot selects intermediate target positions on the original path. These intermediate positions (IPs) are then visited sequentially, until the home position is reached. For the robot to move between two consecutive IPs, it is only required to establish correspondence among at least three corners. This correspondence is obtained through a feature tracking mechanism. The proposed homing scheme is based on the extraction of very low-level sensory information, namely the bearing angles of corners, and has been implemented on a robotic platform. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves homing with a remarkable accuracy, which is not affected by the distance traveled by the robot.},

	abstract = {Programmable force fields have been used as an abstraction to represent a whole new class of devices that have been proposed for part manipulation. The general idea   behind these devices is that a force field is implemented in a plane upon which the part is placed. The forces and torques exerted on the contact surface of the part translate and rotate the part. Manipulation plans for these devices can therefore be considered as strategies for applying a sequence of force fields to bring parts to some desired configuration. Instances of these novel devices are currently implemented using microelectromechanical systems technology, small airjets,  vibration, and small motors. Manipulation in this case is sensorless and nonprehensile and promises to address the handling of very small or very fragile  parts, such as electronics components, that cannot be handled with conventional pick-and-place robotics techniques. In this paper, the authors consider the problem of bringing a part to a stable equilibrium configuration using force fields. The authors study the combination of a unit radial field with a small constant field. A part placed on the radial field moves toward the origin of the radial field but cannot be oriented due to symmetry. Perturbing the radial field with a constant force field breaks the symmetry and gives rise to a finite number of equilibria.   Under certain conditions, there is a unique stable equilibrium configuration. For the case in which these conditions are not fulfilled, the authors provide a comprehensive and unified analysis of the problem that leads to an algorithm to compute all stable equilibrium configurations. The paper contains a detailed discussion on how to implement the algorithm for any part. In the analysis, the authors make extensive use of potential fields. Using the theory of potential fields, the stable equilibrium configurations of a part are equivalent to the local minima of a scalar function. The work presented in this paper leads to the design of   a new generation of efficient, open-loop part feeders that can bring a part to a desired orientation from any initial orientation without the need of sensing or a clock.},

Applications also exist in areas beyond robotics, including computer graphics, computational chemistry, and virtual prototyping. Such applications typically involve high degrees of freedom and a parameterization of the configurations that satisfy closure constraints is usually not available. We show how to implement key primitive operations of randomized path planners for general closed kinematics chains. These primitives include the generation of random free configurations and the generation of local paths. To demonstrate the feasibility of our primitives for general chains, we show their application to recently developed randomized planners and present computed results for high-dimensional problems.},

For part assembly, more than one part needs to be manipulated. This can create problems since there can be interactions between the parts such as impact and friction. Modern technology is beginning to provide the means to control the magnitude and frequency of each actuator of the implemented force field. Thus dynamic and localized force fields can be used for part manipulation. This paper presents a novel strategy to assemble two parts with a sequence of static and dynamic programmable force fields. The strategy involves some initial sensing. Uncertainties occurring in the motion of the parts are taken into account to make the proposed strategy more robust.},

This is done by using a two level approach, a PRM of PRMs. The first level builds a manipulation graph, whose nodes represent stable placements of the manipulated objects while the edges represent transfer and transit actions. The actual motion planning for the transfer and transit paths is done by PRM planners at the second level. The approach is made possible by the introduction of a new kind of roadmap, called the fuzzy roadmap. The fuzzy roadmap contains edges which are not verified by a local planner during construction. Instead, each edge is assigned a number which represents the probability that it is feasible. Later, if the edge is part of a solution path, the edge is checked for collisions. The overall effect is that our roadmaps evolve iteratively until they contain a solution. The use of fuzzy roadmaps in both levels of our manipulation planner offers many advantages. At the first level, a fuzzy roadmap represents the manipulation graph and addresses the problem of having probabilistically complete planners at the second level. At the second level, fuzzy roadmaps drastically reduce the number of collision checks. The paper contains experimental results demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of our scheme.},

The underlying geometric model for the volume is provided by a mass-spring representation. It is augmented by a realistic mechanical model. The latter permits the computation of the shape of the considered object with respect to the grasping constraints by minimizing the energy function of the deformation of the object. Previous research in planning for deformable objects considered the case of elastic plates and proposed a randomized framework for planning paths for plates under manipulation constraints. The present paper modifies and extends the previously proposed framework to handle simple volumes. Our planner builds a roadmap in the configuration space. The nodes of the roadmap are equilibrium configurations of the considered volume under the manipulation constraints, while its edges correspond to quasi-static equilibrium paths. Paths are found by searching the roadmap. We present experimental results that illustrate our approach},

The overall theme of the algorithm, called Lazy PRM, is to minimize the number of collision checks performed during planning and hence minimize the running time of the planner. Our algorithm builds a roadmap in the configuration space, whose nodes are the user-defined initial and goal configurations and a number of randomly generated nodes. Neighboring nodes are connected by edges representing paths between the nodes. In contrast with PRMs, our planner initially assumes that all nodes and edges in the roadmap are collision-free, and searches the roadmap at hand for a shortest path between the initial and the goal node. The nodes and edges along the path are then checked for collision. If a collision with the obstacles occurs, the corresponding nodes and edges are removed from the roadmap. Our planner either finds a new shortest path, or first updates the roadmap with new nodes and edges, and then searches for a shortest path. The above process is repeated until a collision-free path is returned. Lazy PRM is tailored to efficiently answer single planning queries, but can also be used for multiple queries. Experimental results presented in the paper show that our lazy method is very efficient in practice.},

Such a field is extremely interesting as it positions and orients parts without the need of sensing or a clock. We (2000) have proved this conjecture for nonsymmetric parts. In this paper, we focus our attention on symmetric parts and show that some of them can be uniquely positioned and oriented using the same field.

These planners randomly sample the configuration space, building up a roadmap that connects the samples. A major problem is finding valid configurations in tight areas, and many methods have been proposed to more effectively sample these regions. By constructing a skeleton-like subset of the free regions of the workspace, these heuristics can be strengthened. The skeleton provides a concise description of the workspace topology and an efficient means of finding points with maximal clearance from the obstacles. We examine the medial axis as a skeleton, including a method to compute an approximation to it. The medial axis is a two-equidistant surface in the workspace. We form a heuristic for finding difficult configurations using the medial axis, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a planner for rigid objects in a 3D workspace.},

One common task in this process is the search of a large library for small molecules that can achieve both a low-energy conformation and a prescribed pharmacophore. The pharmacophore expresses constraints on the 3D structure of the molecule by specifying relative atom positions that should be maintained to increase the likelihood that the molecule will bind with the receptor site. This paper presents a pharmacophore-based database screening system that has been designed, implemented, and tested on a molecular database. The primary focus of this paper is on a simple, randomized conformational search technique that attempts to simultaneously reduce energy and maintain pharmacophore constraints. This enables the identification of molecules in a database that are likely to dock with a given protein, which can serve as a powerful aid in the search for better drug candidates.},

	abstract = {We present a randomized approach to path planning for articulated robots that have closed kinematic chains. The approach extends the probabilistic roadmap technique which has previously been applied to rigid and elastic objects, and articulated robots without closed chains. It provides a framework for path planning problems that must satisfy closure constraints in addition to standard collision constraints. This expands the power of the probabilistic roadmap technique to include a variety of problems such as manipulation planning using two open-chain manipulators that cooperatively grasp an object, forming a system with a closed chain, and planning for reconfigurable robots where the robot links may be rearranged in a loop to ease manipulation or locomotion. We generate the vertices and edges in our probabilistic roadmap. We focus on the problem of planning the motions for a collection of attached links in a 2D environment with obstacles. The approach has been implemented and successfully demonstrated on several examples.},

This paper improves the performance of these planners by using the medial axis of the workspace to guide the random sampling. At a preprocessing stage, the medial axis of the workspace is computed using a recent efficient algorithm. Then the flexible object is fitted at random points along the medial axis. The energy of all generated configurations is minimized and the planner proceeds to connect them with low-energy quasi-static paths in a roadmap that captures the connectivity of the free space. Given an initial and a final configuration, the planner connects these to the roadmap and searches the roadmap for a path. Our experimental results show that the new sampling scheme is successful in identifying critical deformations of the object along solution paths which results in a significant reduction of the computation time. Our work on planning for flexible objects has applications in industrial settings, virtual reality environments, and medicine.},

The energy function penalizes excessive shear and bending of the part and we assume that low-energy configurations correspond to reversible elastic deformations of the part. The planner captures the connectivity of a space by building a roadmap, a network of simple paths connecting configurations selected in the space using randomized techniques. We report on the implementation of our planner and show experimental results with examples where the surface patch is required to move through a small hole in its workspace.

Early selection of promising molecules can dramatically improve this process, but this selection is often similar to searching for a needle in a haystack. In most cases, all that a chemist initially has is a small collection of molecules that exhibit enough desired activity to hypothesize that they share a 3D atomic substructure binding to the same receptor site. A key problem is to identify this substructure, which can then be used as a pattern to screen databases of molecules. This problem is complicated by the fact that a drug molecule is {\textquotedblleft}flexible{\textquotedblright} and can achieve many low-energy (stable) states. We present search techniques that we have developed to find these low-energy states and to identify common 3D substructures that appear in at least one low-energy state of most molecules in a given collection. We also show experimental results obtained with a software system implementing these techniques.},

	abstract = {Part manipulation is an important but also time-consuming operation in industrial automation. Recent work explores alternative solutions to the mechanical parts feeders which have been traditionally used to sort and orient parts for assembly. One of the proposed alternatives is the use of programmable vector fields. The fields are realized on a plane on which the part is placed. The forces exerted on the part{\textquoteright}s contact surface translate and rotate the part to an equilibrium orientation. Certain vector fields can be implemented in the microscale with actuator arrays and in the macroscale with transversely vibrating plates. Although current technology is still limited, the dexterity that programmable vector fields offer has prompted researchers to further explore their capabilities. This paper presents a vector field that can simultaneously orient and pose most parts into two stable equilibrium configurations. The equilibrium configurations are easily computed a priori given the part to be oriented. Our analysis makes no assumptions about the shape of the part or its connectivity except that it moves as a rigid body. The proposed vector field offers the great advantage of stability of the equilibrium configurations under small perturbations of the part which is key for the orientation of toleranced parts.},

low-energy conformations of each Iigand. Such invariants
of chemically distinct molecules are useful for computational
chemists since they may represent candidate pharmacophores.
A pharmacophore contains the parts of the Iigand that are primarily
responsible for its interaction and binding with a specific
receptor. It is regarded as an inverse image of a receptor and is
used as a template for building more effective pharmaceutical
drugs. The identification of pharmacophores is crucial in drug
design since the structure of the targeted receptor is frequently
unknown, but a number of molecules that interact with the
receptor have been discovered by experiments. It is expected
that our techniques and the results produced by our system will
prove useful in other applications such as molecular database
screening and comparative molecular field analysis.},

	abstract = {A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation (\&ap;150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds)},

	abstract = {This article considers the computational complexity of automat ically determining assembly sequences for mechanical products. Specifically, we address the partitioning problem: given an assembly of rigid parts, identify a proper subassembly that can be removed as a rigid object without disturbing the rest of the assembly. We examine the complexity of the partition ing problem under various types of relative motions allowed for the subassemblies. We show that when arbitrary motions are allowed to separate the two subassemblies, partitioning is NP-complete.

We then describe a general framework for reasoning about assembly motions called the interference diagram. In its most general form the interference diagram yields an exponential- time algorithm to partition an assembly. However, two special cases of the interference diagram studied in this article yield polynomial-time sequencing algorithms. The first case occurs when assembly motions are restricted to single translations. The second case considers infinitesimal rigid motions in translation and rotation and yields a superset of all feasible partitionings. These two algorithms have important practical applications in assembly planning.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the application of a recent approach to path planning for robots with many degrees of freedom (DOF) to articulated robots moving in two or three dimensional static environments. The planning approach, which itself is not restricted to articulated robots, consists of a preprocessing and a planning stage. The preprocessing is done only once for a given environment and generates a connected network of randomly, but properly selected, collision-free configurations (nodes). The planning then connects any given initial and final configurations of the robot to two nodes of the network and computes a path through the network between these two nodes. We show that after paying the preprocessing cost, planning is extremely fast for many difficult examples involving 7-DOF and 12-DOF robots. The approach is particularly attractive for many-DOF robots which have to perform many successive point-to-point motions in the same environment.},

	abstract = {In radiosurgery a beam of radiation is used as an ablative surgical instrument to destroy brain tumors. Treatment planning consists of computing a sequence of beam configurations for delivering a necrotic dose to the tumor, without damaging healthy tissue or particularly critical structures. In current systems, kinematic limitations severely constrain beam motion. This often results in inappropriate dose distributions. A new radiosurgical system has been implemented to overcome this disadvantage. In this system, a compact radiation source of high energy is moved by a 6-dof robotic arm. We describe algorithms for computing a motion with specified characteristics for this new system. Treatment plans used at test sites with earlier systems are compared to plans computed with the described algorithms. The experience reported shows that full kinematic flexibility combined with treatment planning algorithms allows for better protection of healthy tissue and higher dosage in tumors.},
