% The creators and maintainers of this file does not guarantee that
% every entry in this file is correct or complete. Although we do make
% a real effort in maintaining a robust bibliography. If anyone
% finds errors in this file we would appreciate hearing from you. We

% CITE KEY CONVENTION
%
% There are most probably as many cite key conventions as there are BibTeX data
% files around. However, in an effort to share we had to make a choice. Hence,
% this BibTeX data file uses a convention which is based on concatenating the
% first authors last name (not abbreviated) and something characteristic from the
% title (the concatenation is performed with hyphens '-'). The title mnemonic
% can be several words associated with or taken directly from the title. Here is
% an example:
%
%  article{gopinath-cml-tvw,
%    author = {R. A. Gopinath and C. S. Burrus},
%    title = {Factorization Approach to Unitary Time-Varying Filter Banks},
%    ...}
% For further examples look through the file.
%
% ============================================================================== 
% To aid in the organization of the BibTeX data file we opted to use the
% optional key entry. This will then be used to sort the bib file by topic of
% interest. For now I have defined the following key words:
%
% dsp     - traditional dsp topics (filter design and fft alg.)
% wlet    - filter banks and wavelets
% math    - mathematical papers
% control - entries form the control world
% image   - image processing articles/books
% speech  - speech processing articles/books
% comp    - computer related entries
% comm    - communication related papers
% private - private communication entries
% sar     - SAR related papers
%     
% NOTE: Until the information in every entry has been verified we will append a 
%       "*" to the key word (i.e., wlet*) for each entry that has been verified.
%       This will provide us with a way of record keeping until the BibTeX data
%	file is stable!!!
%
% ============================================================================== 
% For convenience and consistency we define the following abbreviations for
% journal and transaction names. The abbreviations is created as follows:
% The first letter indicates whether this is a journal, transaction, proceeding
% etc. The remainder of the abbreviation uses typical abbreviations or other,
% hopefully logical, names/words associated with the publication.
%
% These string abbreviations are used without enclosing them in braces like
% the predefined month abbreviations. E.g., journal = tassp,
