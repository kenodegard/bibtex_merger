abstract = {The hippocampus is thought to be involved in episodic memory formation by reactivating traces of waking experience during sleep. Indeed, the joint firing of spatially tuned pyramidal cells encoding nearby places recur during sleep. We found that the sleep cofiring of rat CA1 pyramidal cells encoding similar places increased relative to the sleep session before exploration. This cofiring increase depended on the number of times that cells fired together with short latencies (<50 ms) during exploration, and was strongest between cells representing the most visited places. This is indicative of a Hebbian learning rule in which changes in firing associations between cells are determined by the number of waking coincident firing events. In contrast, cells encoding different locations reduced their cofiring in proportion to the number of times that they fired independently. Together these data indicate that reactivated patterns are shaped by both positive and negative changes in cofiring, which are determined by recent behavior.},

abstract = {The hippocampus is critical for spatial learning and memory. Hippocampal neurons in awake animals exhibit place field activity that encodes current location, as well as sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity during which representations based on past experiences are often replayed. The relationship between these patterns of activity and the memory functions of the hippocampus is poorly understood. We interrupted awake SWRs in animals learning a spatial alternation task. We observed a specific learning and performance deficit that persisted throughout training. This deficit was associated with awake SWR activity, as SWR interruption left place field activity and post-experience SWR reactivation intact. These results provide a link between awake SWRs and hippocampal memory processes, which suggests that awake replay of memory-related information during SWRs supports learning and memory-guided decision-making.},

abstract = {Hippocampal replay is thought to be essential for the consolidation of event memories in hippocampal-neocortical networks. Replay is present during both sleep and waking behavior, but although sleep replay involves the reactivation of stored representations in the absence of specific sensory inputs, awake replay is thought to depend on sensory input from the current environment. Here, we show that stored representations are reactivated during both waking and sleep replay. We found frequent awake replay of sequences of rat hippocampal place cells from a previous experience. This spatially remote replay was as common as local replay of the current environment and was more robust when the rat had recently been in motion than during extended periods of quiescence. Our results indicate that the hippocampus consistently replays past experiences during brief pauses in waking behavior, suggesting a role for waking replay in memory consolidation and retrieval.},

{\textquoteleft}closest{\textquoteright} example to the query in the database ? b) what is the {\textquoteleft}most probable{\textquoteright} class to which the query belongs ? The answer
to the first question involves study of the geometric properties of the manifold, which then leads to appropriate definitions
of distance metrics on the manifold (geodesics etc). The answer to the second question involves statistical modeling of inter-
and intra-class variations on the manifold. In this paper, we concern ourselves with two related manifolds that often appear in
several vision applications {\textendash} the Stiefel Manifold and the Grassmann Manifold. We describe statistical modeling and inference
tools on these manifolds which result in significant improvements in performance over traditional distance-based classifiers.
We illustrate applications to video-based face recognition and activity recognition.

The advent of molecular biology and, in particular, of genomic sciences is having a deep impact on drug discovery. Recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies have greatly enriched our therapeutic armamentarium. Genome sciences, combined with bioinformatic tools, allow us to dissect the genetic basis of multifactorial diseases and to determine the most suitable points of attack for future medicines, thereby increasing the number of treatment options. The dramatic increase in the complexity of drug research is enforcing changes in the institutional basis of this interdisciplinary endeavor. The biotech industry is establishing itself as the discovery arm of the pharmaceutical industry. In bridging the gap between academia and large pharmaceutical companies, the biotech firms have been effective instruments of technology transfer.},

abstract = {Molecular docking programs are widely used modeling tools for predicting ligand binding modes and structure based virtual screening. In this study, six molecular docking programs (DOCK, FlexX, GLIDE, ICM, PhDOCK, and Surflex) were evaluated using metrics intended to assess docking pose and virtual screening accuracy. Cognate ligand docking to 68 diverse, high-resolution X-ray complexes revealed that ICM, GLIDE, and Surflex generated ligand poses close to the X-ray conformation more often than the other docking programs. GLIDE and Surflex also outperformed the other docking programs when used for virtual screening, based on mean ROC AUC and ROC enrichment values obtained for the 40 protein targets in the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD). Further analysis uncovered general trends in accuracy that are specific for particular protein families. Modifying basic parameters in the software was shown to have a significant effect on docking and virtual screening results, suggesting that expert knowledge is critical for optimizing the accuracy of these methods.},

Inclusion of a methyl group on the $\beta$-position of the pTyr mimic 4-phosphocinnamide enhanced affinity 2- to 3-fold. Bis-pivaloyloxymethyl prodrugs containing $\beta$-methylcinnamide, dipeptide scaffolds Haic and Nle-cis-3,4-methanoproline, and glutamine surrogates were highly potent, completely inhibiting phosphorylation of Stat3 Tyr705 at 0.5-1 $\mu$M in a variety of cancer cell lines. The inhibitors were selective for Stat3 over Stat1, Stat5, Src, and p85 of PI3K, indicating ability to discriminate individual SH2 domains in intact cells. At concentrations that completely inhibited Stat3 phosphorylation, the prodrugs were not cytotoxic to a panel of tumor cells, thereby showing clear distinction between cytotoxicity and effects downstream of activated Stat3.},

multilayered motion planning framework that has been shown
to successfully solve high-dimensional problems with differen-
tial constraints. SyCLoP combines traditional sampling-based
planning with a high-level decomposition of the workspace
through which it attempts to guide a low-level tree of motions.
We investigate a generalization of SyCLoP in which the high-
level decomposition is defined over a given low-dimensional
projected subspace of the state space. We begin with a
manually-chosen projection to demonstrate that projections
other than the workspace can potentially work well. We then
evaluate SyCLoP{\textquoteright}s performance with random projections and
projections determined from linear dimensionality reduction
over elements of the state space, for which the results are
mixed. As we will see, finding a useful projection is a difficult
problem, and we conclude this paper by discussing the merits
and drawbacks of various types of projections.},

uncertainty while solving the simultaneous task and motion

is transferred to the task planning level from the motion

the efficiency of solving the STAMP problem for mobile
manipulators. In this work, Markov Decision Processes are used
in conjunction with TMMs to select sequences of actions that
solve the STAMP problem such that the resulting solutions
have higher probability of feasibility. Experimental evaluation
indicates significantly improved probability of feasibility for
solutions to the STAMP problem, compared to algorithms
that ignore uncertainty information when selecting possible
sequences of actions. At the same time, the efficiency due to
TMMs is largely maintained.},

Modeling conformations of a loop under physiological conditions remains an open problem in computational biology. This article reviews computational research in loop modeling, highlighting progress and challenges. Important insight is obtained on potential directions for future research.},

Such simulations, however, can be prohibitively difficult or lengthy for large proteins or when probing the lower-resolution, long-timescale behaviors of proteins generally. Importantly, not all questions about a protein system require full space and time resolution to produce an informative answer. For instance, by avoiding the simulation of uncorrelated, high-frequency atomic movements, a larger, domain-level picture of protein dynamics can be revealed. The purpose of this review is to highlight the growing body of complementary work that goes beyond simulation. In particular, this review focuses on methods that address kinematics and dynamics, as well as those that address larger organizational questions and can quickly yield useful information about the long-timescale behavior of a protein.},

	abstract = {When multiple robots operate in the same environment, it is desirable for scalability purposes to coordinate their motion in a distributed fashion while providing guarantees about their safety. If the robots have to respect second-order dynamics, this becomes a challenging problem, even for static environments. This work presents a replanning framework where each robot computes partial plans during each cycle, while executing a previously computed trajectory.  Each robot communicates with its neighbors to select a trajectory that is safe over an infinite time horizon. The proposed approach does not require synchronization and allows the robots to dynamically change their cycles over time. This paper proves that the proposed motion coordination algorithm guarantees safety under this general setting. This framework is not specific to the underlying robot dynamics, as it can be used with a variety of dynamical systems, nor to the planning or control algorithm used to generate the robot trajectories. The performance of the approach is evaluated using a distributed multi-robot simulator on a computing cluster, where the simulated robots are forced to communicate by exchanging messages. The simulation results confirm the safety of the algorithm in various environments with up to 32 robots governed by second-order dynamics.},

Computational docking or computer-aided docking is an extremely useful tool to gain an understanding of protein-ligand interactions which is important for the drug discovery. Computational docking is the process of computationally predicting the placement and binding affinity of the ligand in the binding pocket of the protein. Docking methods rely on a search algorithm which computes the placement of the ligand in the binding pocket and a scoring function which estimates the binding affinity, i.e., how strongly the ligand interacts with the protein. A variety of methods have been developed to solve the computational docking problems that range from simple point-matching algorithms to explicit physical simulation methods.

This work reports, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational molecular docking study to model all of the 142 peptidomimetics that mimic the Stat3 inhibitory pTyr-X-X-Glu motif. We used the docking  programs AUTODOCK and VINA to model SH2 domain-peptidomimetic complexes and estimate their binding affinities. We obtained better  screening accuracy using AUTODOCK which ranked the most potent inhibitor as second highest. Experimental binding energy values and scores from docking programs correlated poorly, confirming the limitations of many current docking programs when dealing with ligands that have a large number of rotatable bonds. Nevertheless, for close to 65\% of peptidomimetics, the structures of complexes computed by AUTODOCK are in agreement with current understanding of the structures. Modeling of the SH2 domain-peptidomimetic complexes is essential to better understand and design drug compounds for curing cancer. Our study is an important first step forward towards that goal.},

	abstract = {As robots become more versatile, they are increasingly found to operate together in the same environment where they must coordinate their motion in a distributed manner. Such operation does not present problems if the motion is quasi-static and collisions can be easily avoided. However, when the robots follow second-order dynamics, the problem becomes challenging even for a known environment. The setup in this work considers that each robot replans its own trajectory for the next replanning cycle. The planning process must guarantee the robot{\textquoteright}s safety by ensuring collision-free paths for the considered period and by not bringing the robot to states where collisions cannot be avoided in the future. This problem can be addressed through communication among the robots, but it becomes complicated when the replanning cycles of the different robots are not synchronized and the robots make planning decisions at different time instants. This paper shows how to guarantee the safe operation of multiple communicating second-order vehicles, whose replanning cycles do not coincide, through an asynchronous, distributed motion planning framework. The method is evaluated through simulations, where each robot is simulated on a different processor and communicates with its neighbors through message passing. The simulations confirm that the approach provides safety in scenarios with up to 48 robots with second-order dynamics in environments with obstacles, where collisions occur often without a safety framework.},

	abstract = {Background
There is an increasing number of proteins with known structure but unknown function. Determining their function would have a significant impact on understanding diseases and designing new therapeutics. However, experimental protein function determination is expensive and very time-consuming. Computational methods can facilitate function determination by identifying proteins that have high structural and chemical similarity.

Results
We present LabelHash, a novel algorithm for matching substructural motifs to large collections of protein structures. The algorithm consists of two phases. In the first phase the proteins are preprocessed in a fashion that allows for instant lookup of partial matches to any motif. In the second phase, partial matches for a given motif are expanded to complete matches. The general applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated with three different case studies. First, we show that we can accurately identify members of the enolase superfamily with a single motif. Next, we demonstrate how LabelHash can complement SOIPPA, an algorithm for motif identification and pairwise substructure alignment. Finally, a large collection of Catalytic Site Atlas motifs is used to benchmark the performance of the algorithm. LabelHash runs very efficiently in parallel; matching a motif against all proteins in the 95\% sequence identity filtered non-redundant Protein Data Bank typically takes no more than a few minutes. The LabelHash algorithm is available through a web server and as a suite of standalone programs at http://labelhash.kavrakilab.org. The output of the LabelHash algorithm can be further analyzed with Chimera through a plugin that we developed for this purpose.

Conclusions
LabelHash is an efficient, versatile algorithm for large-scale substructure matching. When LabelHash is running in parallel, motifs can typically be matched against the entire PDB on the order of minutes. The algorithm is able to identify functional homologs beyond the twilight zone of sequence identity and even beyond fold similarity. The three case studies presented in this paper illustrate the versatility of the algorithm.},

Discrete search uses a workspace decomposition to compute leads, i.e., sequences of regions in the neighborhood that guide sampling-based motion planning during the state-space exploration. In return, information gathered by motion planning, such as progress made, is fed back to the discrete search. This combination allows SyCLoP to identify new directions to lead the exploration toward the goal, making it possible to efficiently find solutions, even when other planners get stuck. Simulation experiments with dynamical models of ground and flying vehicles demonstrate that the combination of discrete search and motion planning in SyCLoP offers significant advantages. In fact, speedups of up to two orders of magnitude were obtained for all the sampling-based motion planners used as the continuous layer of SyCLoP.},

	pages = {242},
	abstract = {Background
Structural variations caused by a wide range of physicochemical and biological sources directly influence the function of a protein. For enzymatic proteins, the structure and chemistry of the catalytic binding site residues can be loosely defined as a substructure of the protein. Comparative analysis of drug-receptor substructures across and within species has been used for lead evaluation. Substructure-level similarity between the binding sites of functionally similar proteins has also been used to identify instances of convergent evolution among proteins. In functionally homologous protein families, shared chemistry and geometry at catalytic sites provide a common, local point of comparison among proteins that may differ significantly at the sequence, fold, or domain topology levels.

Results
This paper describes two key results that can be used separately or in combination for protein function analysis. The Family-wise Analysis of SubStructural Templates (FASST) method uses all-against-all substructure comparison to determine Substructural Clusters (SCs). SCs characterize the binding site substructural variation within a protein family. In this paper we focus on examples of automatically determined SCs that can be linked to phylogenetic distance between family members, segregation by conformation, and organization by homology among convergent protein lineages. The Motif Ensemble Statistical Hypothesis (MESH) framework constructs a representative motif for each protein cluster among the SCs determined by FASST to build motif ensembles that are shown through a series of function prediction experiments to improve the function prediction power of existing motifs.

Conclusions
FASST contributes a critical feedback and assessment step to existing binding site substructure identification methods and can be used for the thorough investigation of structure-function relationships. The application of MESH allows for an automated, statistically rigorous procedure for incorporating structural variation data into protein function prediction pipelines. Our work provides an unbiased, automated assessment of the structural variability of identified binding site substructures among protein structure families and a technique for exploring the relation of substructural variation to protein function. As available proteomic data continues to expand, the techniques proposed will be indispensable for the large-scale analysis and interpretation of structural data.},

Results: We present new algorithms for finding metabolic pathways, given a desired start and target compound, that conserve a given number of atoms by tracking the movement of atoms through metabolic networks containing thousands of compounds and reactions. First, we describe an algorithm that identifies linear pathways. We then present a new algorithm for finding branched metabolic pathways. Comparisons to known metabolic pathways demonstrate that atom tracking enables our algorithms to avoid many unrealistic connections, often found in previous approaches, and return biologically meaningful pathways. Our results also demonstrate the potential of the algorithms to find novel or non-standard pathways that may span multiple organisms.

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of motion planning for mobile robots involving discrete constraints on dynamics, and high-level temporal goals. The robot is modeled as a nonlinear hybrid system with the discrete transitions modeling the discrete constraints. We use a multi-layered
synergistic framework that has been proposed recently for solving planning problems involving hybrid systems and high-level temporal goals. A high-level planner uses a user-defined discrete abstraction of the hybrid system as well as exploration information to suggest high-level plans. A low-level sampling-based planner uses the dynamics of the hybrid system and the suggested high-level plans to explore the state-space for feasible solutions. In our previous work, we have proposed a geometry-based approach for the construction of the discrete abstraction for the case when the robot is modeled as a continuous system. Here, we extend the approach for the construction of the discrete abstraction to the case when the robot is modeled as nonlinear hybrid system. To use the resulting abstraction more efficiently, we also propose a lazy-search  approach for high-level planning that reduces the size of the search space by reusing previously constructed high-level plans for initializing the search. The new techniques are tested experimentally for second-order nonlinear hybrid robot models in challenging workspace environments with obstacles and for a variety of temporal logic specifications.

The material is taught in undergraduate and graduate robotics classes in computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and aeronautical engineering, but at an abstract level. Deep learning could be achieved by having students implement and test different motion planning strategies. However, it is practically impossible in the context of a single class to have undergraduates implement motion planning algorithms that are powerful and fun to use, even when the students have proficient programming skills. Due to lack of supporting educational material, students are often asked to implement simple (and uninteresting) motion planning algorithms from scratch, or access thousands of lines of code and just figure out how things work. We present an ongoing project to develop microworld software and a modeling curriculum that supports undergraduate acquisition of motion planning knowledge and tool use by computer science and engineering students. The goal is to open the field of motion planning and robotics to young and enthusiastic talent.},

Traditional biophysics-based conformational search methods require a large number of calculations and are hard to apply to large-scale conformational motions. 

Results: In this work we investigate the application of a robotics-inspired method, using backbone and limited side chain representation and a coarse grained energy function to trace large-scale conformational motions. We tested the algorithm on four well known medium to large proteins and we show that even with relatively little information we are able to trace low-energy conformational pathways efficiently. The conformational pathways produced by our methods can be further filtered and refined to produce more useful information on the way proteins function under physiological conditions.

Conclusions: The proposed method effectively captures large-scale conformational changes and produces pathways that are consistent with experimental data and other computational studies. The method represents an important first step towards a larger scale modeling of more complex biological systems.},

The method efficiently obtains a large set of equilibrium conformations in two stages: first exploring the entire space at a coarse-grained level of detail, then narrowing a refined exploration to selected low-energy regions. The coarse-grained exploration periodically adds all-atom detail to selected conformations to ensure that the search leads to regions which maintain low energies in all-atom detail. The second stage reconstructs selected low-energy coarse-grained conformations in all-atom detail. A low-dimensional energy landscape associated with all-atom conformations allows focusing the exploration to energy minima and their conformational ensembles. The lowest energy ensembles are enriched with additional all-atom conformations through further multiscale exploration. The lowest energy ensembles obtained from the application of the method to three different proteins correctly capture the known functional states of the considered systems.},

A challenging aspect of this problem is how to utilize communication so that vehicles do not reach states from which collisions cannot be avoided due to second-order motion constraints. This paper initially shows how it is possible to provide theoretical safety guarantees with a priority-based coordination scheme. Safety means avoiding collisions with obstacles and between vehicles. This notion is also extended to include the retainment of a communication network when the vehicles operate as a networked team. The paper then progresses to extend this safety framework into a fully distributed communication protocol for real-time planning. The proposed algorithm integrates sampling-based motion planners with message-passing protocols for distributed constraint optimization. Each vehicle uses the motion planner to generate candidate feasible trajectories and the message-passing protocol for selecting a safe and compatible trajectory. The existence of such trajectories is guaranteed by the overall approach. The theoretical results have also been experimentally confirmed with a distributed simulator built on a cluster of processors and using applications such as coordinated exploration. Furthermore, experiments show that the distributed protocol has better scalability properties when compared against the priority-based scheme.},

               approach to motion planning that is suitable for challenging
               problems involving robots with kinodynamic constraints. Initially
               the method decomposes the workspace to build a graph that
               encodes the physical adjacency of the decomposed regions. This
               graph is searched to obtain leads, that is, sequences of regions that
               can be explored with sampling-based tree methods to generate
               solution trajectories. Instead of treating the discrete search of
               the adjacency graph and the exploration of the continuous state
               space as separate components, DSLX passes information from
               one to the other in innovative ways. Each lead suggests what
               regions to explore and the exploration feeds back information
               to the discrete search to improve the quality of future leads.
               Information is encoded in edge weights, which indicate the
               importance of including the regions associated with an edge in
               the next exploration step. Computation of weights, leads, and the
               actual exploration make the core loop of the algorithm.

               Extensive experimentation shows that DSLX is very versatile.
               The discrete search can drastically change the lead to reflect
               new information allowing DSLX to find solutions even when

	abstract = {Many pathogens target the complement system as part of their strategy of escaping the immune system. In this context, the extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein (Efb) and the Staphylococcal complement inhibitor (SCIN) from Staphylococcus aureus have been recognized as exceptionally potent complement inhibitors. While both proteins interfere at the level of C3 convertases, their molecular mechanisms and binding specificities are clearly distinct. In view of the increasingly problematic infections with S. aureus and the potential of microbial evasion proteins as templates for therapeutic complement inhibitors, more details about their mode of action are urgently needed.
Here we present extensive molecular studies on the structure, interaction properties and binding specificities of Efb, and show that its target spectrum is far greater than initially expected. In particular, we found that its C-terminal domain (Efb-C) efficiently prevents the interaction of C3d with complement receptor 2 and therefore may have direct consequences for the bridging to adaptive immune responses. Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we confirmed the induction of conformational changes in C3 upon binding of Efb-C and demonstrate that such changes may significantly alter the interaction pattern of C3b with a number of ligands and regulators. Furthermore, we extended our characterization of the binding interface between Efb-C and C3d based on structural, biophysical, and computational methods, which identified additional key residues and showed that this important interaction is largely driven by electrostatic forces.
Finally, we show that SCIN not only interacts with the assembled C3 convertase but also directly binds to C3b at an area distant from the Efb-C binding site. Biophysical experiments confirmed that SCIN stabilizes the C3 convertase and indicate that the inhibitor prevents cleavage but not the initial binding of native C3 to the convertase.

In contrast, class II genes contain a TATA box in their promoter, and tend to have pronounced expression variability both at the single cell level (in constant environment) and at the population level (in changing environmental conditions). Here we show that the positioning and regulation of class I and class II genes is strikingly different in the large-scale transcriptional regulatory (TR) network of S. cerevisiae. We also show that class I and class II genes differ dramatically in several properties, including gene expression variability at diverse time scales and population sizes, mutational variance, gene essentiality and subcellular localization. This dichotomy might indicate that evolution placed different genes in different locations within the cell and within the TR network, according to some fundamental principles that govern cellular information processing and survival in a changing environment.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing number of proteins with known structure but unknown function. Determining their function	 would have a significant impact on understanding diseases	 and designing new therapeutics. However, experimental protein function determination is expensive and very	 time-consuming. Computational methods can facilitate	 function determination by identifying proteins that have	 high structural and chemical similarity. Our focus is on	 methods that determine binding site similarity. Although	 several such methods exist, it still remains a challenging	 problem to quickly find all functionally-related matches	 for structural motifs in large data sets with high	 specificity. In this context, a structural motif is a set	 of 3D points annotated with physicochemical information	 that characterize a molecular function. We propose a new	 method called LabelHash that creates hash tables of	 $n$-tuples of residues for a set of targets. Using these	 hash tables, we can quickly look up partial matches to a	 motif and expand those matches to complete matches. We show	 that by applying only very mild geometric constraints we	 can find statistically significant matches with extremely	 high specificity in very large data sets and for very	 general structural motifs. We demonstrate that our method	 requires a reasonable amount of storage when employing a	 simple geometric filter and further improves on the	 specificity of our previous work while maintaining very	 high sensitivity. Our algorithm is evaluated on 20 homolog	 classes and a non-redundant version of the Protein Data	 Bank as our background data set. We use cluster analysis to	 analyze why certain classes of homologs are more difficult	 to classify than others. The LabelHash algorithm is implemented on a web server at	 http://kavrakilab.org/labelhash/.},

	title = {Prediction of enzyme function based on 3D templates of evolutionarily important amino acids},
	journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
	volume = {9},
	year = {2008},
	abstract = {Background:
Structural genomics projects such as the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) yield many new 
structures, but often these have no known molecular functions. One approach to recover this 
information is to use 3D templates{\textemdash}structure-function motifs that consist of a few functionally 
critical amino acids and may suggest functional similarity when geometrically matched to other 
structures. Since experimentally determined functional sites are not common enough to define 
3D templates on a large scale, this work tests a computational strategy to select relevant residues 
for 3 emplates. 

Results:
Based on evolutionary information and heuristics, an Evolutionary Trace Annotation (ETA) 
pipeline built templates for 98 enzymes, half taken from the PSI, and sought matches in a non- 
redundant structure database. On average each template matched 2.7 distinct proteins, of which 
2.0 share the first three Enzyme Commission digits as the template{\textquoteright}s enzyme of origin. In many 
cases (61\%) a single most likely function could be predicted as the annotation with the most 
matches, and in these cases such a plurality vote identified the correct function with 87\% 
accuracy. ETA was also found to be complementary to sequence homology-based annotations. 
When matches are required to both geometrically match the 3D template and to be sequence 
homologs found by BLAST or PSI-BLAST, the annotation accuracy is greater than either 
method alone, especially in the region of lower sequence identity where homology-based 
annotations re east eliable. 

Conclusions:
These data suggest that knowledge of evolutionarily important residues improves functional 
annotation among distant enzyme homologs. Since, unlike other 3D template approaches, the 
ETA method bypasses the need for experimental knowledge of the catalytic mechanism, it 
should prove a useful, large scale, and general adjunct to combine with other methods to

	address = {Philadelphia, PA},
	abstract = {The identification of protein function is crucial to understanding cellular processes and selecting novel proteins as drug targets. However, experimental methods for determining protein function can be expensive and time-consuming. Protein partial structure comparison methods seek to guide and accelerate the process of function determination by matching characterized functional site representations, motifs, to substructures within uncharacterized proteins, matches. One common difficulty of all protein structural comparison techniques is the computational cost of obtaining a match. In an effort to maintain practical efficiency, some algorithms employ efficient geometric threshold-based searches to eliminate biologically irrelevant matches. Thresholds refine and accelerate the method by limiting the number of potential matches that need to be considered. However, because statistical models rely on the output of the geometric matching method to accurately measure statistical significance, geometric thresholds can also artificially distort the basis of statistical models, making statistical scores dependant on geometric thresholds and potentially causing significant reductions in accuracy of the functional annotation method. This paper proposes a point-weight based correction approach to quantify and model the dependence of statistical scores to account for the systematic bias introduced by heuristics. Using a benchmark dataset of 20 structural motifs, we show that the point-weight correction procedure accurately models the information lost during the geometric comparison phase, removing systematic bias and greatly reducing misclassification rates of functionally related proteins, while maintaining specificity.

The method does not assume a specific disulfide bond pairing for cysteines and allows the possibility of unpaired cysteines. A detailed view of the conformational space relevant for the native state is obtained through a hierarchic multi-resolution exploration. A crucial feature of the exploration is a geometric approach that efficiently generates a large number of distinct cyclic conformations independently of one another. A spatial and energetic analysis of the generated conformations associates a free-energy landscape to the explored conformational space. Application to three long cyclic peptides of different folds shows that the conformational ensembles and cysteine arrangements associated with free energy minima are fully consistent with available experimental data. The results provide a detailed analysis of the native state features of cyclic peptides that can be further tested in experiment.},

These motif matching algorithms identify matches of geometric and chemical similarity between well-studied functional sites, motifs, and substructures of functionally uncharacterized proteins, targets. For the purpose of function prediction, the accuracy of motif matching algorithms can be evaluated with the number of statistically significant matches to functionally related proteins, true positives (TPs), and the number of statistically insignificant matches to functionally unrelated proteins, false positives (FPs). Our earlier work developed cavity-aware motifs which use motif points to represent functionally significant atoms and C-spheres to represent functionally significant volumes. We observed that cavity-aware motifs match significantly fewer FPs than matches containing only motif points. We also observed that high-impact C-spheres, which significantly contribute to the reduction of FPs, can be isolated automatically with a technique we call Cavity Scaling. This paper extends our earlier work by demonstrating that C-spheres can be used to accelerate point-based geometric and chemical comparison algorithms, maintaining accuracy while reducing runtime. We also demonstrate that the placement of C-spheres can significantly affect the number of TPs and FPs identified by a cavity-aware motif. While the optimal placement of C-spheres remains a diffcult open problem, we compared two logical placement strategies to better understand C-sphere placement. },

	abstract = {The study of disease often hinges on the biological function of proteins, but determining protein function is a difficult experimental process. To minimize duplicated effort, algorithms for function prediction seek characteristics indicative of possible protein function. One approach is to identify substructural matches of geometric and chemical similarity between motifs representing known active sites and target protein structures with unknown function. In earlier work, statistically significant matches of certain effective motifs have identified functionally related active sites. Effective motifs must be carefully designed to maintain similarity to functionally related sites (sensitivity) and avoid incidental similarities to functionally unrelated protein geometry (specificity). Existing techniques design motifs using the geometry of a single protein structure. Poor selection of this structure can limit motif effectiveness if the selected functional site lacks similarity to functionally related sites. To address this problem, this paper presents composite motifs, which combine structures of functionally related active sites to potentially increase sensitivity. Our experimentation compares the effectiveness of composite motifs with simple motifs designed from single protein structures. On six distinct families of functionally related proteins, leave-one-out testing showed that composite motifs had sensitivity comparable to the most sensitive of all simple motifs and specificity comparable to the average simple motif. On our data set, we observed that composite motifs simultaneously capture variations in active site conformation, diminish the problem of selecting motif structures, and enable the fusion of protein structures from diverse data sources.

Resolving these issues depends partially on a thorough understanding of the biological function of proteins. Unfortunately, the experimental determination of protein function is expensive and time consuming. To support and accelerate the determination of protein functions, algorithms for function prediction are designed to gather evidence indicating functional similarity with well studied proteins. One such approach is the MASH pipeline, described in the first half of this paper. MASH identifies matches of geometric and chemical similarity between motifs, representing known functional sites, and substructures of functionally uncharacterized proteins (targets). Observations from several research groups concur that statistically significant matches can indicate functionally related active sites.

One major subproblem is the design of effective motifs, which have many matches to functionally related targets (sensitive motifs), and few matches to functionally unrelated targets (specific motifs). Current techniques select and combine structural, physical, and evolutionary properties to generate motifs that mirror functional characteristics in active sites. This approach ignores incidental similarities that may occur with functionally unrelated proteins. To address this problem, we have developed Geometric Sieving (GS), a parallel distributed algorithm that efficiently refines motifs, designed by existing methods, into optimized motifs with maximal geometric and chemical dissimilarity from all known protein structures. In exhaustive comparison of all possible motifs based on the active sites of 10 well-studied proteins, we observed that optimized motifs were among the most sensitive and specific.

               field, it also makes the evaluation of new methods time consuming.

               We propose that a systems approach is needed for the development and
               the experimental validation of new motion planners and/or components
               in existing motion planners. In this paper, we present the Online,
               Open-source, Programming System for Motion Planning (OOPSMP), a
               programming infrastructure with an open interface.

              OOPSMP provides implementations of various existing algorithms in a
              modular, object-oriented fashion that is easily
              extendable. The system is open-source, since a
              community-based effort better facilitates the
              development of a common infrastructure and is less prone
              to errors. We hope that researchers will contribute
              their optimized implementations of their methods and
              thus improve the quality of the code available for
              use. A dynamic web interface and a dynamic linking
              architecture at the programming level allows users to
              easily add new planning components, algorithms,
              benchmarks, and experiment with different
              parameters. The system allows the direct comparison of
              new contributions with existing approaches on the same
              hardware and programming infrastructure. },

PEM models global equilibrium fluctuations of a polypeptide chain by combining local fluctuations of consecutive overlapping fragments of the chain. Local fluctuations are computed by a probabilistic exploration that exploits analogies between proteins and robots. All generated conformations are subjected to energy minimization and then are weighted according to a Boltzmann distribution. Using the theory of statistical mechanics the Boltzmann-weighted fluctuations corresponding to each fragment are combined to obtain fluctuations for the entire protein. The agreement obtained between PEM-modeled fluctuations, wet-lab experiment and guided simulation measurements, indicates that PEM is able to reproduce with high accuracy protein equilibrium fluctuations that occur over a broad range of timescales.},

	Abstract = {Advances in simulation techniques and computing hardware have created a substantial overlap between the timescales accessible to atomic-level simulations and those on which the fastest-folding proteins fold. Here we demonstrate, using simulations of four variants of the human villin headpiece, how simulations of spontaneous folding and unfolding can provide direct access to thermodynamic and kinetic quantities such as folding rates, free energies, folding enthalpies, heat capacities, Φ-values, and temperature-jump relaxation profiles. The quantitative comparison of simulation results with various forms of experimental data probing different aspects of the folding process can facilitate robust assessment of the accuracy of the calculations while providing a detailed structural interpretation for the experimental observations. In the example studied here, the analysis of folding rates, Φ-values, and folding pathways provides support for the notion that a norleucine double mutant of villin folds five times faster than the wild-type sequence, but following a slightly different pathway. This work showcases how computer simulation has now developed into a mature tool for the quantitative computational study of protein folding and dynamics that can provide a valuable complement to experimental techniques.},

	Abstract = {Physics-based simulation represents a powerful method for investigating the time-varying behavior of dynamic protein systems at high spatial and temporal resolution. Such simulations, however, can be prohibitively difficult or lengthy for large proteins or when probing the lower-resolution, long-timescale behaviors of proteins generally. Importantly, not all questions about a protein system require full space and time resolution to produce an informative answer. For instance, by avoiding the simulation of uncorrelated, high-frequency atomic movements, a larger, domain-level picture of protein dynamics can be revealed. The purpose of this review is to highlight the growing body of complementary work that goes beyond simulation. In particular, this review focuses on methods that address kinematics and dynamics, as well as those that address larger organizational questions and can quickly yield useful information about the long-timescale behavior of a protein.

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new motion planner, Search Tree with Resolution Independent Density Estimation (STRIDE), designed for rapid exploration and path planning in high-dimensional systems (greater than 10). A Geometric Near- neighbor Access Tree (GNAT) is maintained to estimate the sampling density of the configuration space, allowing an implicit, resolution-independent, Voronoi partitioning to provide sampling density estimates, naturally guiding the planner towards unexplored regions of the configuration space. This planner is capable of rapid exploration in the full dimension of the configuration space and, given that a GNAT requires only a valid distance metric, STRIDE is largely parameter-free. Extensive experimental results demonstrate significant dimension- dependent performance improvements over alternative state-of-the-art planners. In particular, high-dimensional systems where the free space is mostly defined by narrow passages were found to yield the greatest performance improvements. Experimental results are shown for both a classical 6-dimensional problem and those for which the dimension incrementally varies from 3 to 27.},

abstract = {Modeling conformational changes in protein docking calculations is challenging. To make the calculations tractable, most current docking algorithms typically treat proteins as rigid bodies and use soft scoring functions that implicitly accommodate some degree of flexibility. Alternatively, ensembles of structures generated from molecular dynamics (MD) may be cross-docked. However, such combinatorial approaches can produce many thousands or even millions of docking poses, and require fast and sensitive scoring functions to distinguish them. Here, we present a novel approach called "EigenHex," which is based on normal mode analyses (NMAs) of a simple elastic network model of protein flexibility. We initially assume that the proteins to be docked are rigid, and we begin by performing conventional soft docking using the Hex polar Fourier correlation algorithm. We then apply a pose-dependent NMA to each of the top 1000 rigid body docking solutions, and we sample and re-score multiple perturbed docking conformations generated from linear combinations of up to 20 eigenvectors using a multi-threaded particle swarm optimization algorithm. When applied to the 63 "rigid body" targets of the Protein Docking Benchmark version 2.0, our results show that sampling and re-scoring from just one to three eigenvectors gives a modest but consistent improvement for these targets. Thus, pose-dependent NMA avoids the need to sample multiple eigenvectors and it offers a promising alternative to combinatorial cross-docking.},

abstract = {The NMSim web server implements a three-step approach for multiscale modeling of protein conformational changes. First, the protein structure is coarse-grained using the FIRST software. Second, a rigid cluster normal-mode analysis provides low-frequency normal modes. Third, these modes are used to extend the recently introduced idea of constrained geometric simulations by biasing backbone motions of the protein, whereas side chain motions are biased toward favorable rotamer states (NMSim). The generated structures are iteratively corrected regarding steric clashes and stereochemical constraint violations. The approach allows performing three simulation types: unbiased exploration of conformational space; pathway generation by a targeted simulation; and radius of gyration-guided simulation. On a data set of proteins with experimentally observed conformational changes, the NMSim approach has been shown to be a computationally efficient alternative to molecular dynamics simulations for conformational sampling of proteins. The generated conformations and pathways of conformational transitions can serve as input to docking approaches or more sophisticated sampling techniques. The web server output is a trajectory of generated conformations, Jmol representations of the coarse-graining and a subset of the trajectory and data plots of structural analyses.

A deformable elastic network (DEN) is used to restrain the sampling to prior knowledge of an approximate structure. The DEN restraints dramatically reduce over-fitting, especially at low resolution.

Molecular Dynamics has gained substantial use, but remains computationally demanding and difficult to setup for many biologists. Elastic network models (ENMs) are an alternative and have been shown to generate the dominant equilibrium motions of biomolecules quickly and efficiently. These dominant motions have been shown to be functionally relevant and also to indicate the likely direction of conformational changes. Most structures have a small number of dominant motions. Comparing computed motions to the structure's conformational ensemble derived from a collection of static structures or frames from an MD trajectory is an important way to understand functional motions as well as evaluate the models. Modes of motion computed from ENMs can be visualized to gain functional and mechanistic understanding and to compute useful quantities such as average positional fluctuations, internal distance changes, collectiveness of motions, and directional correlations within the structure.},

  abstract = {Current genomic perspectives on animal diversity neglect two prominent phyla, the molluscs and annelids, that together account for nearly one-third of known marine species and are important both ecologically and as experimental systems in classical embryology. Here we describe the draft genomes of the owl limpet (Lottia gigantea), a marine polychaete (Capitella teleta) and a freshwater leech (Helobdella robusta), and compare them with other animal genomes to investigate the origin and diversification of bilaterians from a genomic perspective. We find that the genome organization, gene structure and functional content of these species are more similar to those of some invertebrate deuterostome genomes (for example, amphioxus and sea urchin) than those of other protostomes that have been sequenced to date (flies, nematodes and flatworms). The conservation of these genomic features enables us to expand the inventory of genes present in the last common bilaterian ancestor, establish the tripartite diversification of bilaterians using multiple genomic characteristics and identify ancient conserved long- and short-range genetic linkages across metazoans. Superimposed on this broadly conserved pan-bilaterian background we find examples of lineage-specific genome evolution, including varying rates of rearrangement, intron gain and loss, expansions and contractions of gene families, and the evolution of clade-specific genes that produce the unique content of each genome.},

  abstract = {Sea anemones are seemingly primitive animals that, along with corals, jellyfish, and hydras, constitute the oldest eumetazoan phylum, the Cnidaria. Here, we report a comparative analysis of the draft genome of an emerging cnidarian model, the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. The sea anemone genome is complex, with a gene repertoire, exon-intron structure, and large-scale gene linkage more similar to vertebrates than to flies or nematodes, implying that the genome of the eumetazoan ancestor was similarly complex. Nearly one-fifth of the inferred genes of the ancestor are eumetazoan novelties, which are enriched for animal functions like cell signaling, adhesion, and synaptic transmission. Analysis of diverse pathways suggests that these gene “inventions” along the lineage leading to animals were likely already well integrated with preexisting eukaryotic genes in the eumetazoan progenitor.},

	Abstract = {One particularly time-consuming step in protein crystallography is interpreting the electron density map; that is, fitting a complete molecular model of the protein into a 3D image of the protein produced by the crystallographic process. In poor-quality electron density maps, the interpretation may require a significant amount of a crystallographer's time. Our work investigates automating the time-consuming initial backbone trace in poor-quality density maps. We describe ACMI (Automatic Crystallographic Map Interpreter), which uses a probabilistic model known as a Markov field to represent the protein. Residues of the protein are modeled as nodes in a graph, while edges model pairwise structural interactions. Modeling the protein in this manner allows the model to be flexible, considering an almost infinite number of possible conformations, while rejecting any that are physically impossible. Using an efficient algorithm for approximate inference--belief propagation--allows the most probable trace of the protein's backbone through the density map to be determined. We test ACMI on a set of ten protein density maps (at 2.5 to 4.0 A resolution), and compare our results to alternative approaches. At these resolutions, ACMI offers a more accurate backbone trace than current approaches.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: One bottleneck in high-throughput protein crystallography is interpreting an electron-density map, that is, fitting a molecular model to the 3D picture crystallography produces. Previously, we developed ACMI (Automatic Crystallographic Map Interpreter), an algorithm that uses a probabilistic model to infer an accurate protein backbone layout. Here, we use a sampling method known as particle filtering to produce a set of all-atom protein models. We use the output of ACMI to guide the particle filter's sampling, producing an accurate, physically feasible set of structures.
RESULTS: We test our algorithm on 10 poor-quality experimental density maps. We show that particle filtering produces accurate all-atom models, resulting in fewer chains, lower sidechain RMS error and reduced R factor, compared to simply placing the best-matching sidechains on ACMI's trace. We show that our approach produces a more accurate model than three leading methods--Textal, Resolve and ARP/WARP--in terms of main chain completeness, sidechain identification and crystallographic R factor.
